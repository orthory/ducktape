//! the REAL [`WorkspaceProvisioner`] for portable (v1) agent runs: one
//! per-run workspace under a D7-validated root, materialized from whichever
//! source the run's envelope pinned.
//!
//! two lanes, dispatched on [`WorkspaceSource`]:
//! - **duckfs** ([`duckfs`]): checkout / commit a duckfs subtree over the
//!   node's `/v1` surface ([`crate::node_link::NodeLink`]).
//! - **forge** ([`forge`]): a git WORKTREE of a node-local forge repo at the
//!   run's pinned commit, committed with agent authorship and pushed back
//!   through this node's own loopback smart-HTTP lane so the branch move
//!   settles through consensus (wire contract §4). configured per binary via
//!   [`NodedProvisioner::with_forge`]; unconfigured or unusable (no repo
//!   base, no http surface, no worktree-capable host `git`) the lane fails
//!   each forge attempt LOUDLY while duckfs runs are untouched.
//!
//! this lives in the noded LIB crate — the only place `duckfs-client` (the
//! checkout/commit engine) and the node's `/v1` lane are both reachable, the
//! reachability wall compute-service cannot cross. It runs in the COMPUTE
//! DAEMON's process, not the node's: every consensus read and write below goes
//! over `/v1`, so the provisioner has no in-process dependency on the node at
//! all.
//!
//! whichever lane materializes it, every run is handed the same TOOL PLANE
//! ([`run_env`] + [`tool_path_entries`]): the bin dir of the running binary on
//! `PATH` (where `ducktape mcp` ships), the node's http base as `DUCKTAPE_NODE`,
//! and its agent id as `DUCKTAPE_RUN_AGENT`. that is enough for the MCP server
//! — which the runner CLI spawns OUTSIDE the agent's sandbox — to find the node
//! and know who it acts for; the GRANT itself is never in the env (see
//! [`run_env`]).
//!
//! D7 (isolation floor): the per-run dir is minted under [`agent_runs_root`],
//! a root VALIDATED at boot to be OUTSIDE `<storage>` — so a `..` from a
//! checkout can NOT reach `user.key`, the node keys, qmdb, the blobstore, or
//! forge's git substrate. the managed `/v1/fs/workspaces` root stays under
//! `<storage>`; this is a distinct, relocated root for live agent runs.
