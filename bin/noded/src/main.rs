//! the ducktape node daemon: ONE embedded host behind http/ws.
//!
//! two runtimes, one thread each way: the node actor owns the (non-Send)
//! `host::Host` inside a commonware `tokio::Runner` — the qmdb-backed modules
//! need its storage context — and drains [`NodeCommand`]s in arrival order, one
//! msg per block. the axum server runs on a plain tokio runtime on the main
//! thread and only ever talks to the actor over the command channel. every app
//! build is a client: the web build dials this directly; the desktop shell
//! spawns it detached (an orphan — it outlives the window) and connects the
//! same way. POST /v1/admin/shutdown is how a client retires it: no pid handshake,
//! the port IS the daemon's identity.
//!
//! run: `cargo run -p noded-bin -- [--listen 127.0.0.1:8844] [--storage <dir>]
//! [--modules <dir>]`
//!
//! without `--storage` state lives in a fresh temp dir (clean run each boot).
//! with it, qmdb modules, the forge repo, and the per-module index persist;
//! the local block counter resumes ABOVE the index's watermark, so op-log
//! heights stay monotonic across restarts (a counter restarting at 0 would
//! make every new block look already-indexed and be silently skipped).
