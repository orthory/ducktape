//! a runnable multi-process ducktape node over REAL sockets.
//!
//! this is the in-sim N-validator simplex proof (consensus/tests/
//! simplex_agreed_order.rs) turned into an actual network: instead of N
//! `SimplexOrderer`s over ONE `p2p::simulated` network under the DETERMINISTIC
//! clock, each process here stands up its OWN live simplex `Engine` over a real
//! `authenticated::lookup` encrypted TCP mesh on the REAL tokio runtime, and
//! drives an `OrderedNode<SimplexOrderer>` over a `host::Host`.
//!
//! the machinery is REUSED verbatim: `consensus::SimplexOrderer::spawn` is
//! already generic over the runtime context + the three engine channel pairs, so
//! the only substrate that changes vs the sim is (a) `tokio::Runner` instead of
//! `deterministic::Runner` (the p2p actors live-lock under the deterministic clock),
//! (b) `lookup::Network` channels instead of `simulated::Network`, and (c) a
//! per-process `ContentStore`.
//!
//! payload dissemination is REAL: each process submits a DISTINCT op (node N
//! creates task `kN`), so a peer that finalizes another node's op-digest
//! has NO local bytes for it. `SimplexOrderer::spawn_with_resolver` wires a
//! `ConsensusRelay` that, at propose time, gossips the proposed frame's bytes to
//! all peers on the payload channel; every peer's STORE-ONLY drain caches them, so
//! when that digest finalizes the reporter resolves it locally and delivers it in
//! BFT order. content-addressing IS the verification (the drain re-hashes on
//! receipt). the relay gossip is one-shot, and quorum is a SUBSET — a validator
//! can finalize a view whose gossip it missed — so a lazy payload FETCH lane
//! backstops it: the resolver pulls missing bytes by digest from the tracked
//! mesh and fills the finalized slot instead of wedging the apply prefix. this
//! is what lets DISTINCT ops converge across processes with per-process stores
//! — quorum votes still cross the real TCP mesh to finalize.
//!
//! ## state-sync service and the sync-only joiner
//!
//! every validator also serves the statesync wire protocol on
//! `CHANNEL_STATE_SYNC`, answered between drains from its latest finalized
//! boundary — so responses are always block-consistent without locks. run with
//! `--sync-only` and the process joins the mesh WITHOUT a consensus engine,
//! pulls a manifest + every module from the bootstrapper over that channel,
//! rebuilds them against their consensus-committed roots, prints its composed
//! `synced root_hash=`, and exits 0 — the network-backed joiner path over real
//! sockets. membership note: `peer_seeds` is the AUTHORIZED MESH (everyone,
//! including sync-only joiners); `validator_seeds` (default: peer_seeds) is the
//! CONSENSUS participant set — the split that lets a non-validator sync.
//!
//! each validator prints its GENESIS root-hash at startup and its CONVERGED
//! root-hash once it has applied ALL validator ops. the demo script asserts every
//! process's genesis line agrees, every converged line agrees, and the sync-only
//! joiner's synced line equals the converged line.
