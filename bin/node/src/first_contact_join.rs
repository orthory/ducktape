//! The joiner's first-contact race over the invite's unified path set.
//!
//! A unified all-paths invite offers the joiner MORE than one way to bring its
//! WireGuard tunnel up: the inviter itself, plus every reachable member the
//! inviter meshes with (the invite's `fronts`). This module turns that set into
//! ONE candidate list (`{inviter} ∪ {fronts}`), races first contact across the
//! whole union, and stops at the first candidate whose doorbell SETTLES THE
//! GATE (join ADR §4: the sealed intro is the gate request, and the acked
//! `Admitted`/terminal `Rejected` is the authoritative outcome) — cancelling
//! the rest. If every path is exhausted it returns an HONEST terminal (a
//! distinct, mode-naming failure the caller surfaces loudly and exits on),
//! never a silent success.
//!
//! Two mechanics, reused verbatim from PR #260:
//! - a candidate with a routable underlay `endpoint` is DIRECT: install the
//!   join-window tunnel peer at that endpoint, then announce the token-signed
//!   intro over plain UDP to its intro listener (`wg_port + 1`) until acked;
//! - a candidate with no endpoint is COORDINATED (by identity): drive
//!   `BootstrapCoordinatedInvitePeer` through the joiner's AMBIENT coordinator
//!   until the ack rides back over the punched underlay.
//!
//! Item 2 adds a THIRD, last-resort mechanic: when the UDP race exhausts every
//! offered path (the network eats outbound UDP), the SAME candidates are
//! re-raced through the coordinator's TCP/443 relay lane ([`RelayFallback`]) —
//! the sealed intro rides a TCP stream to the relay, which forwards it to the
//! member as one UDP datagram and pumps the member's sealed acks back. The
//! member needs zero changes; only the joiner's transport differs.
//!
//! The decision logic (union building, TUN-mode filtering, first-ack-wins,
//! honest terminal) is pure and unit-tested; the two real mechanics live below
//! it and are exercised end-to-end against a live plane.
