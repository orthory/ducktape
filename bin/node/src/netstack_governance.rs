//! The governance trigger for the reachability plane's backend: a node-local
//! reconciler that converges this node's netstack machine onto the component
//! the module code registry designates under the `netstack` id.
//!
//! WHY IT IS NOT THE MODULE BOUNDARY. `Host::realize_module_swaps` realizes
//! consensus module code: it is fail-closed by construction (a node that
//! cannot run the agreed code must not apply the block) and it runs INSIDE the
//! drain. The reachability machine is neither — it is sans-I/O, per-node,
//! pre-genesis networking that contributes no root-hash, and a swap is
//! accepted at any event boundary with no cross-validator synchrony
//! requirement. So the registry is used here as the COMMITMENT RECORD ONLY
//! (governance's existing `RegisterModule` / `UpdateModule` wire surface, no
//! new action, no wire change) and this task — off the drain, off the select
//! loop — reads it and drives the same `swap_netstack()` conversion the admin
//! route drives. Nothing here can defer a frame or return `Err` to the drain.
//!
//! THE DESIGNATION IS THE PENDING RECORD, AT ITS ACTIVATION HEIGHT. A
//! `ducktape:netstack` component is not a `ducktape:module`, so no validator's
//! readiness probe can load it and `ScheduleRegister`'s R = n latch never
//! closes for it: the entry stays pending, and the pending hash IS what
//! governance designated. The HEIGHT half of the schedule is honoured
//! regardless — governance schedules a swap AT a height and the registry's
//! minimum swap lead exists so every node cuts over on the same block. (The
//! module boundary skips such a record outright — see
//! `Host::skip_foreign_admission`.)
//!
//! ONE SWAP PER DESIGNATION — spent by a MACHINE'S ANSWER, not by an attempt.
//! A backend that refuses the swap (a component built against another
//! contract, refused by name before a byte of state is decoded) refuses it
//! identically every time and keeps running untouched, so that refusal is said
//! once and never retried; only a NEW designation is acted on again. The two
//! non-answers heal on their own and retry on the next block: bytes this node
//! does not hold yet (the code plane's push and the readiness pump's fetch
//! land them), and a swap no plane was running to answer.
