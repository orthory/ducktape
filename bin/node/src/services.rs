//! The per-workspace service grants — `services.toml` beside `node.toml` —
//! and the `ducktape service` family that edits them.
//!
//! A service is offchain muscle (compute, storage, ...) with no sovereign
//! identity: identity and transport belong to the node. So a daemon can only
//! SIGNAL presence to its node (`POST /v1/services/hello`, a volatile catalog
//! — see `noded::services`), and the user decides whether it may act. That
//! decision is this file: `service enable <kind>` mints the grant, `service
//! disable <kind>` retires it, and the node's compute plane gates on the
//! result at boot.
//!
//! Why a sibling file rather than a `[services]` table in node.toml: node.toml
//! is the operator's network plumbing, written once by `init`/`join` and
//! hand-rendered with its own documentation. Everything a CLI verb edits at
//! runtime already lives in its own sibling (`gateway-routes.json`,
//! `invite-fronts.json`, `coord.cap`), and this follows that precedent.
