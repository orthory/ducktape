//! `ducktape service run airlock` — the standalone credential-LENDING daemon.
//!
//! The node process no longer embeds a gateway. This serves the operator's own
//! `airlock-creds` store in its own process, with its own failure domain, and
//! reaches its node exactly the way the CLI does — over localhost `/v1`.
//!
//! ## the autonomous stance
//!
//! Nothing assigns work to this daemon. Its desired state is entirely local:
//! the credentials the operator registered with `ducktape user cred add`, and
//! the grants those credentials carry on chain. There is no roles module, so
//! there is no assignment to reconcile against and no stance machinery here to
//! build one from.
//!
//! ## inbound is transport, not protocol
//!
//! This daemon binds a LOOPBACK listener and its port is published as the
//! account's signed `airlock` gateway route. Overlay traffic for
//! `airlock.<handle>.duck` lands on the NODE's `Service::Gateway` stream plane,
//! which authenticates the WireGuard peer, names it as the caller node,
//! enforces the signed `RouteStatement` policy, and only then dials this
//! listener. That is strictly better than a directly-bound daemon: a keyless
//! service has no overlay identity to bind with, and the node's route policy is
//! a real enforcement layer a direct bind would not have.
//!
//! The invariant that matters survives either way: **no `/v1` request carries
//! that traffic, and nothing is ever pushed to this daemon over its node link.**
//! The link is used in exactly one direction, for exactly one thing — reading
//! committed state to decide a grant.
//!
//! ## TEE trust is bilateral; the node is uninvolved
//!
//! This gateway does not attest. Its trust anchor is the seal PUBLIC key on
//! consensus, which the borrower's broker pins from the credential record. An
//! enclave-attested lender is `bin/airlock-gateway`, a separate minimal binary,
//! and seal_pk pinning + quote verification stay strictly between client and
//! airlock. Neither path routes any of it through the node.
//!
//! ## it spawns nothing
//!
//! No provider set, no sandbox, no reaper, no VMs. A lending node is often a
//! laptop with no hypervisor access at all — no `/dev/kvm`, no guest images —
//! which is exactly why the hello path must not demand one.
