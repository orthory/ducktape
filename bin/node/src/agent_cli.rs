//! `ducktape agent` — remote/interactive sandboxed provider sessions, plus the
//! two run-control verbs.
//!
//! Two session verbs, one credential+targeting story:
//!
//! - `agent pty [<provider>] [--host-node <hex>] [--cred <name>] [--cpu <n>] [--mem <gb>]`
//!   attaches THIS terminal to a provider running in a microVM on a host
//!   node (default: this node). The CLI talks ONLY to its own node's ws surface
//!   (`/v1/ws`); the node does the cross-node mesh. Raw terminal mode + resize
//!   forwarding make it feel like ssh.
//! - `agent sched [<provider>] --cred <name> [--host-node <hex>] [--cpu] [--mem] -- "<prompt>"`
//!   submits a durable, node-pinned headless run (a `saga::SagaMsg::Trigger`)
//!   as a frame the USER key signs, and prints its run id. The saga's origin is
//!   the user key, so the lender attributes the run to the user's account
//!   (`OfKey`) when the pinned node asks to draw on `--cred`. The target may be
//!   offline now and execute on reconnect — that durability is the point.
//!
//! Two run-control verbs — `agent cancel <run-id>` and `agent reassign <run-id>
//! [--attempt N]` — act on a run of EITHER lane, and the id itself picks which:
//!
//! - an id inside the signing key's own saga namespace ([`saga::owns_id`]) is a
//!   `sched` run, the one an operator can create here, so cancel/reassign are
//!   `SagaMsg::Cancel`/`SagaMsg::Reassign`. Cancel is the useful one: `agent
//!   sched` PINS its saga to the target node (`pinned_assignee`), and saga
//!   refuses to reassign a pinned saga outright — there is no other provider to
//!   move it to. Reassign on this lane can only fence an attempt;
//! - anything else is a `runs` turn claim from the chat- and jobs-driven lane,
//!   so they are `RunsMsg::CancelRun`/`RunsMsg::ReassignRun`. Both act there.
//!
//! The operator holding a run id has no reason to know which module minted it,
//! and the two id spaces are disjoint, so the CLI asks the id rather than the
//! operator. Both ride the same user-signed frame lane `sched` uses, and neither
//! pre-checks who may act: the module decides on every validator — runs admits
//! the run's creator or the agent's owner, saga only the recorded trigger origin
//! — and its refusal sentence is what comes back.
//!
//! What the lanes do NOT share is how a no-op reads. Runs REFUSES an id it does
//! not hold (`unknown run: …`); saga is deliberately SILENT for a finished,
//! unknown or foreign saga, so a `sched` control op that lands prints
//! "submitted", never "accepted".
//!
//! Which is also how the wrong `--key` reads: a `sched` id in ANOTHER key's
//! namespace is not this key's to control, so it takes the runs lane and comes
//! back `unknown run: ext:<hex>…`. That sentence means "not your run", not "no
//! such run" — sign with the key that submitted the `agent sched`.
//!
//! `<provider>` is optional when `--cred` names a credential: the registry
//! record's kind decides what to launch; an explicit provider contradicting the
//! cred is an error.
//!
//! TWO addressing inputs, deliberately two names. `--node`/`-n`/`DUCKTAPE_NODE`
//! (the shared [`NodeAddr`] group) say which node this CLI DIALS — an http base.
//! `--host-node` says which PEER runs the work: its raw 64-hex node key. They
//! are different types; spelling both `--node` is what made the flag mean two
//! things.
//!
//! Program output stays `println!` (a CLI's stdout is not logging); the pty
//! passthrough writes raw provider bytes straight to stdout.
