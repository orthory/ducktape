//! the node-local worker behind the modules registry's code-swap byte-receipt gate: the state-driven
//! the per-swap byte-receipt readiness signaller for CODE swaps.
//!
//! it polls COMMITTED modules registry state each pump tick and, per pending swap,
//! drives this validator to a truthful `ModulesMsg::SwapReady`:
//!
//! - bytes verified-resident AND loadable on this binary → self-submit ONE
//!   signal (latched locally; the module's committed readiness set keeps it
//!   idempotent across restarts).
//! - bytes absent → report the digest so the pump spawns a ranged fetch
//!   (the custodian's data-plane push normally lands first; the fetch heals
//!   a node the push missed).
//! - bytes held but not loadable on this binary → report the refusal once and
//!   stay silent. Never signal what is not held AND not runnable: "ready" is a
//!   machine statement that `sha256(local bytes) == committed hash` and that
//!   THIS build can instantiate them. Residency alone let a validator on an
//!   older binary arm a swap it then deterministically rejected every op to
//!   while its peers applied them — a silent fork (#1297).
//!
//! deliberately NOT a `host::worker::Worker` (same reasoning as the upgrade
//! signaller): readiness must survive restart/late-join, so every decision
//! re-derives from committed state instead of reacting to one-shot effects.
