//! the submit-relay channel wire format — how a relaying node delivers a
//! signed frame, and how a validator answers with the frame's consensus fate.
//!
//! transport: ordinary submits ship the frame bytes on `CHANNEL_SUBMIT_RELAY`
//! to one current validator, exactly as `node::encode_frame` produced them.
//! a frame that references a node-local forge pack first fans that pack out to
//! EVERY current validator in bounded, content-addressed chunks; only after all
//! validators acknowledge the bytes does one validator take consensus custody.
//! the frame's OWN signature is the AUTHORSHIP: it binds
//! (origin, seq, target, payload) to the origin key, so forgery is impossible,
//! and a byte-identical replay collapses in the consensus lane's exactly-once
//! digest gate. authorship is not admission, though — the RELAYING peer must
//! itself hold committed node standing (member or resident), exactly as
//! `verify_blob_offer` requires of a blob offer. consensus custody is a bounded
//! resource, and a door open to every mesh peer is a door open to anyone who
//! reaches the mesh. the check is on the COURIER, never on the frame's origin:
//! a resident relays frames signed by keys with no standing at all (an agent's
//! per-run session key), and every one of them still enters consensus on the
//! same contract as a validator's local HTTP submit lane. who may do WHAT is
//! per-module policy, decided deterministically inside the state machine (the
//! acl module's dispatch gate plus each module's own origin checks), never at
//! the transport door. the validator takes consensus custody via
//! `submit_frame` and replies when the frame drains — Applied with the sealed
//! block's coordinates, Rejected for a deterministic no-op, Refused for door
//! failures and expired holds.
//!
//! json on the wire: matches the module-interface idiom. blob chunks use hex rather than a
