//! the root-divergence watch: does a peer's finalized state root agree with

//!
//! simplex orders `sha256(frame)` digests — the certificate binds ordered
//! BYTES, never a root — so two nodes whose fold produced different state
//! agree on every block and keep finalizing, voting and serving `/v1`. the
//! roots are already on the wire: the detection lane's [`statesync::TipCoords`]
//! carries `(height, root_hash)` as an atomic pair, every validator answers
//! it, and until now only a node that was CATCHING UP ever compared one.
//!
//! DETECTION ONLY. nothing here refuses a peer, drops a connection, re-routes
//! a source, gates admission or votes — a divergence is named in the log and
//! that is all. the composed root is not committed in consensus (that is a
//! wire change and its own arc), so this makes the fork nameable within a
//! poll cycle rather than preventing it.
