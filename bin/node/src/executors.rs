//! `ducktape agent install` — the agent CLIs a guest image lends to runs.
//!
//! A run executes inside a Linux microVM on EVERY host, so the CLI baked into
//! the image must be a Linux build for the GUEST's architecture. On Linux the
//! operator's own CLI happens to be exactly that, which is why reading the host
//! `PATH` worked for as long as nobody built an image on a Mac — where the
//! vendor's installer produces a Mach-O binary the guest cannot exec at all.
//!
//! So the binary is acquired deliberately, into the WORKSPACE's `executors/`
//! directory — per network, like every other file a node runs with: two
//! networks on one machine lend two independent sets, and a throwaway network
//! takes its CLIs with it when it goes — and the node derives the guest's copy
//! from whatever is there (`sandbox_host::executor_image`). This verb owns that
//! directory and the one approved way to fill it.
//!
//! THREE RULES IT EXISTS TO KEEP:
//!
//! 1. NOTHING IS FETCHED WITHOUT THE OPERATOR ASKING FOR IT. Bare
//!    `agent install` shows what is missing and what installing it would
//!    download — the checklist IS the approval, and unchecking everything is a
//!    complete answer. Nothing else in the tree fetches an executable.
//! 2. WHAT IS INSTALLED IS THE VENDOR'S LATEST, VERIFIED AGAINST THE VENDOR'S
//!    CHECKSUM FOR IT. Each executor's capability spec names its release
//!    channel (`[source]`); this verb asks the channel what is current, reads
//!    the checksum the vendor publishes for that release, and refuses bytes
//!    that do not match it. No version and no hash lives in this tree: a pin
//!    written down anywhere is stale the day after it is written.
//! 3. WHAT WAS INSTALLED IS WRITTEN DOWN. A receipt beside the directory
//!    (`<workspace>/executors.toml`) records, per provider, the release this
//!    verb installed and the sha256 of the bytes it wrote. That is what lets a
//!    newer vendor release show up as `BUMP` on the next `agent install`
//!    instead of a silent `ok` over old bytes, and what keeps the operator's
//!    own build from ever being offered for replacement unasked.
//!
//! WHY THE CHECKSUM MATTERS MORE THAN USUAL: this executable runs inside the
//! sandbox that holds the operator's provider credential. The sandbox is what
//! protects the HOST from the CLI; it is not what protects the CREDENTIAL from
//! it.
//!
//! The operator does not have to use this verb at all — dropping their own
//! Linux build into the directory is equally valid (it reports as `own`), and
//! the image builder's ELF check stays for exactly that case. This is a
//! convenience with a receipt, not a gate.
