//! `ducktape collab` — the operator's seam onto a collaboration conversation:
//! attach a personal provider session to it, and read its protected state.
//!
//! ## the whole design, in one sentence
//!
//! Every verb here is a signed request to the operator's OWN node over `/v1`,
//! so messaging needs no inbound socket on any laptop, borrows no pty, and
//! survives an agent daemon reconnect.
//!
//! ## why an attachment is a chain write and not a session
//!
//! A binding names WHICH conversation a device will receive, and it has to
//! outlive every process involved — that is the difference between a mailbox
//! and a terminal. The interactive plane cannot hold one: `agent-service`'s
//! `Sessions::close_all` ends every live pty the moment the daemon's ws link to
//! its node drops (`bin/node/src/agent/link.rs`), and a dropped link is
//! ORDINARY — the node restarts, the operator upgrades, the socket blips. A
//! binding stored there would be revoked by a network hiccup.
//!
//! So a binding is committed module state. The daemon learns its bindings by
//! reading committed state, the way compute already learns its placement, and
//! the link's teardown cannot reach them. Nothing in this file touches
//! `Sessions`, a `term:` topic, `TermInput` or `TermOutput`; pty bytes are raw
//! and unstructured and are not a delivery channel. Pinned by this file's own
//! `the_collab_plane_never_touches_the_pty_plane`, which fails the build if the
//! two planes ever touch.
//!
//! ## reads are authenticated, and that is not free
//!
//! `/v1/query` is open to anything that can dial the port — a sandbox guest
//! reaching this listener over its vsock tunnel included — and the module
//! answering it sees `Origin::System`, which proves nothing about the caller.
//! A participant id in such a query is a client's claim. So protected reads go
//! to `/v1/query/reader`, where the caller's own signature names the reader and
//! the node hands the VERIFIED key to the module as its origin.
//!
//! That authenticates the reader at the RPC edge. It is not confidentiality:
//! bodies live in replicated committed state, so every validator can read them.
//! Nothing here promises end-to-end encryption.
//!
//! Program output stays `println!` — a CLI's stdout is not logging.
