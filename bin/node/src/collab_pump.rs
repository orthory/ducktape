//! The node's collaboration half: committed state out to the agent daemon,
//! the daemon's receipts back into committed state.
//!
//! The daemon owns no chain and the module owns no pty, so something has to
//! stand between them. That is this, and it is deliberately the only place
//! either direction crosses:
//!
//! ```text
//!   collaboration module ──read──> pump ──wire::Command──> agent daemon
//!   collaboration module <─Acknowledge─ pump <─wire::Event─ agent daemon
//! ```
//!
//! ## every read is authenticated as the binding, not as the node
//!
//! Reads go out on [`noded::NodeCommand::QueryAs`] carrying the binding's
//! SCOPED SERVICE KEY as the reader, never the node's own identity. The module
//! refuses `Origin::System` for all of `ProtectedRead`, so a node cannot read a
//! channel's delivery records it holds no binding on — including the ones its
//! own operator owns. `via` names the channel the key is scoped to, because
//! the key store is hashed and the module cannot find the binding by scanning.
//!
//! The BODY is chat's. A delivery record names a chat message by id, and the
//! pump reads that message over the node's public query lane: a chat message
//! is replicated committed state that every validator holds in plaintext, so
//! nothing about it is protected by the collaboration module.
//!
//! ## the deadline is the network's, and it is asked immediately before
//!
//! Nothing here consults a wall clock. A delivery window is checked with
//! `ProtectedRead::DeliveryEligibility` — judged against the block's
//! `consensus_time` — in the same sweep that hands the message over, so a
//! message that expired while an earlier one was being read is never delivered
//! under a verdict taken before it. A historical `adapter_accepted` in the
//! receipt is a FACT about what happened, and the module is explicit that it is
//! not permission to deliver again; the pump asks eligibility and never reads a
//! receipt to decide.
//!
//! ## what is never replayed
//!
//! Only a `Stored` record is handed over. `Queued` means the daemon's durable
//! journal already owns it, `Held` means a provider is holding it, and
//! `DeliveryUnknown` means nobody can establish whether input was accepted —
//! the spec forbids replaying that automatically, and the module answers
//! `NotReplayable` so the pump cannot even by mistake.
