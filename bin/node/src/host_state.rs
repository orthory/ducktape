//! Application-host construction, restoration, and state synchronization.
//!
//! This module owns the three host lifecycles — genesis, checkpoint restore,
//! and state sync — over the ONE composer ([`noded::compose`]). Each lifecycle
//! injects only what differs: WHERE its stores come from (a fresh/reopened
//! `QmdbStore::init`, or a `sync_from` at a verified root), WHERE its
//! snapshots come from (the checkpoint, or the peer's snapshot lane), and
//! WHICH boundary it composes at (block zero over the genesis bundle, or the
//! modules registry's roster at the checkpoint or manifest height). Every
//! wasm module's shape is its component's own declaration; the genesis wasm
//! is the workspace genesis file's — every component verified against the
//! descriptor's hashes and seeded into the node's blob plane, every index
//! guest converged into the index, never embedded in the binary; and the
//! network bindings ride every path, so a module the registry admitted after
//! a checkpoint seeds its config at restore exactly as it did live. Every
//! host leaves here wired: the admissions factory over the node's canonical
//! substrates, and an index database for every module it runs.
