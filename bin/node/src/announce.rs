//! The capability announce: what this node tells the network it can execute.
//!
//! Two facts feed it, and they are deliberately NOT the same fact:
//!
//! - **consent** — the operator approved kind K on this node (`services.toml`,
//!   written by `service enable`/`disable`). Durable, and it changes only when
//!   a human runs a verb.
//! - **liveness** — K's daemon is signaling right now (the volatile
//!   [`noded::services::ServiceCatalog`], 30 s TTL). Ephemeral, and known only
//!   to this node.
//!
//! The announce is their intersection, so it has two triggers and ONE writer:
//!
//! - the **verb** submits on a consent change, synchronously, and reports the
//!   commit height to the human who ran it ([`crate::services::enable`]);
//! - the **watcher** below submits on a liveness transition ([`spawn`]).
//!
//! Both go through the SAME door — `POST /v1/submit`, which frames the op with
//! the node's own key and answers only once consensus has settled. Nothing here
//! submits through `OrderedNode::submit`, and that is the whole design: that
//! call is fire-and-forget by construction and lives inside the drain loop that
//! produces the very commits it would have to await, which is why the pump this
//! module replaces needed a frame latch, a two-tier give-up budget and an
//! outcome route back from the drain. A blocking POST from outside the loop
//! needs none of them.
//!
//! No daemon ever submits an announce: N daemons each doing a declarative
//! replace of one shared tag set would clobber each other. One writer, always
//! the node.
