//! `ducktape service run agent` — the standalone interactive-terminal daemon.
//!
//! The node process spawns no pty and constructs no provider set. This does
//! both, in its own process with its own failure domain, and reaches its node
//! exactly the way the CLI does — over localhost `/v1` + ws.
//!
//! ## the boundary, and why it is where it is
//!
//! The terminal plane splits AT THE PTY, not at the session. Everything above
//! the pty stayed on the node because it could not leave:
//!
//! - the scrollback and command rings are owned by the node's stream hub, and a
//!   pty client attaches to the NODE's `/v1/ws` to read them;
//! - cross-node sessions ride the mesh term plane, which authenticates peers by
//!   mesh `PeerId` and answers admission from committed state on the node's
//!   actor lane. A daemon holds no keypair and no mesh identity, so that path
//!   stays node-to-node — which is what the design always said it was.
//!
//! What crossed is exactly the sandbox-touching half: provider discovery,
//! `spawn_interactive`, and each session's pump and reaper. That is the whole
//! milestone — after this, `bin/node` constructs none of them.
//!
//! ## agent and compute are siblings
//!
//! This daemon makes no call of any kind to the compute daemon, and needs none:
//! an interactive session is self-contained. Both link the same
//! provider/sandbox/broker libraries and spawn their own sandboxes; their bus,
//! where they have one at all, is the chain.
//!
//! Co-tenancy is not a hazard here, and the microVM backend is why: a run's VMM
//! is a child of the daemon that started it and dies with it, so there is no
//! shared daemon, no shared storage root and no shared reaper to confuse. Run
//! ownership is still recorded per instance (`agent#<hex8>`) so a restarted
//! daemon can tell its own leftovers from a sibling's.
//!
//! ## the credential path is unchanged in shape
//!
//! broker-host is still the mandatory per-run isolation boundary: every session
//! gets a per-run loopback endpoint the sandboxed child dials with an opaque
//! bearer, and the real credential never enters the sandbox. Airlock is still
//! only a credential SOURCE, resolved by the NODE from committed gateway state
//! and handed here as a public record (see `agent_service::wire`). This daemon
//! owns no keypair; it never needs one, because it never submits anything.
