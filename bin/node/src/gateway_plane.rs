//! Secure gateway reverse proxy over the purpose-specific overlay stream.
//!
//! A consumer resolves a signed global route, opens `Service::Gateway` to that
//! exact publisher node, and sends one bounded HTTP-shaped request. The
//! publisher re-resolves the route, revalidates Identity authority, maps the
//! authenticated WireGuard peer to its caller account, enforces the signed
//! audience/method/body/header policy, and only then touches DuckFS or one
//! exact node-local loopback upstream.
