//! `ducktape user cred` — named, grantable, owner-hosted API credentials.
//!
//! `cred add claude|codex` wraps the vendor's OWN login CLI (`claude auth login`,
//! `codex login`) on a local pty, captures the login artifact directly into this
//! node's disk-backed gateway store (`<storage>/airlock-creds/<name>/`), and
//! registers the record on-chain (name → owner account, publisher node, kind,
//! seal_pk) so any granted node's broker can resolve the name and complete a
//! round-trip through the owner's co-hosted gateway WITHOUT ever holding the
//! secret. `cred add apple-codesign` enrols a Developer ID signing identity
//! the same way, from files the operator exported (no vendor login exists),
//! after running the gateway's own admission checks locally so a refused
//! identity never reaches the store or the chain. `grant`/`revoke`
//! lend/rescind by account; `list` reads committed records; `remove`
//! tombstones one.
//!
//! `inspect`/`seal` are the ENCLAVE half of the same family and live in
//! [`crate::cred_seal`]: they talk to a TEE airlock gateway
//! (`bin/airlock-gateway`) whose quote they verify themselves. They are the only
//! two verbs here that neither sign an on-chain statement nor touch the store.
//!
//! Every other verb runs CO-HOSTED with the node whose credential it manages: it reads
//! the node's own workspace (chain id, consensus key, storage) to build the
//! owner-signed statement, then submits it as a USER-signed frame over
//! `/v1/submit/frame` — the frame's signer is the op origin, which the gateway
//! resolves to the owner account through `OfKey`; the record's
//! `publisher_node` is a statement field the account vouches for. Program
//! output stays `println!` (a CLI's stdout is not logging).
