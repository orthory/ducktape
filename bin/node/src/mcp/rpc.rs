//! deliberately hand-rolled rather than pulled from a crate. the server speaks
//! exactly four methods (`initialize`, `notifications/initialized`,
//! `tools/list`, `tools/call`) and a protocol that is one struct deep — an SDK
//! would be more code to configure than to replace, and it would put a
//! dependency between the agent tool plane and someone else's release cadence.
//!
//! framing rule: a REQUEST carries an `id` and gets exactly one response; a
//! NOTIFICATION carries none and gets NOTHING back. answering a notification is
//! a protocol violation that some clients treat as fatal, so the loop must be
//! able to tell them apart — hence `id: Option<Value>` rather than a defaulted
//! id.
