//! the read plane: everything an agent could previously only be TOLD, it can
//! ask for.
//!
//! before this plane existed a run saw exactly what the composer pre-injected
//! into its envelope — the anchored conversation, and a forge item's context if
//! it had one. it could not look up the task it was asked about, read the page
//! it was told to comment on, or open the sibling issue that explains the one it
//! is working. every one of those had to be foreseen in consensus, at compose
//! time, by code that could not know what the agent would want.
//!
//! the plane is four tools. `ducktape_whoami` answers who this run is.
//! `ducktape_actions` lists the catalog: the write operations the runs module
//! owns, straight from consensus, beside the read operations this binary
//! serves. `ducktape_query` runs one read operation by name with the same
//! `operation`/`target`/`input` envelope a write takes, and `ducktape_receipt`
//! reads a write's committed receipt back. reads cross no consensus op, so
//! their table lives here; writes are the module's, so their table does not.
//!
//! queries are built from each module's OWN `*Query` enum rather than
//! hand-written json, so a wire change in `chat` or `forge` breaks this file at
//! COMPILE time instead of at run time in front of a model.
//!
//! reads are not gated: a run reads what any member of the network reads. the
//! `query` operation is the floor under the typed table — any module's own
//! query, verbatim — so a read the table lacks a name for is still one call.
