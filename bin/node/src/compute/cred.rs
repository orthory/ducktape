//! Executing-node credential resolution: turn a run's named gateway credential
//! into a self-host airlock broker source, gated on the run's committed saga
//! origin.
//!
//! A `ducktape agent sched --cred <name>` run carries the credential NAME in its
//! envelope, never any secret. On the node that executes the run, this resolver
//! turns that name into ROUTING METADATA and nothing else: where the owner's
//! gateway is (`airlock.<handle>.duck`), which vendor it fronts, and the public
//! seal key to pin.
//!
//! ## it does not decide who is acting — it says WHICH WORK, and nothing else
//!
//! It used to decide. It read the run's saga origin, mapped that submitting node
//! to an account, and shipped that ACCOUNT to the lender as the grant subject —
//! a claim by the COMPUTE layer about who a run acts for, which the lender had
//! no way to check. That was a reproduced credential-theft hole and PR #833
//! deleted it.
//!
//! What this resolver ships now is a POINTER: the run's `saga_id`, and nothing
//! else. The lender resolves it in ITS OWN committed state — every node sees the
//! same chain — and reads out of consensus who submitted the saga, who holds its
//! lease, and whether that submitter is granted. The executor asserts none of
//! those three facts and cannot influence any of them. The load-bearing reason
//! this is safe is stated on [`airlock::wire::WorkRef`]: `/v1/submit` discards a
//! caller's claimed submitter id and re-signs with the node's own key, so the
//! committed `SagaOrigin::External` is a signature-proven node key.
//!
//! What that means for an operator: a run submitted by A and executed on B draws
//! on A's grant when B holds A's lease — that is the delegated lane — and
//! otherwise on B's own. Either consent alone is enough for the CREDENTIAL; the
//! executor's separate `work admit` decision (whether it runs A's work at all)
//! is a different consent in the opposite direction and both must hold.
//!
//! The resolver reads state over the same committed-query lane (`/v1/query`)
//! the agent provisioner uses, so it sees exactly what consensus committed —
//! and it runs in the COMPUTE DAEMON's process, so "the executing node" is the
//! node this daemon serves.
