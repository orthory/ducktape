//! the compute daemon's work intake: the `watch` verb in its cheapest form.
//!
//! A daemon executes no blocks, so no effect ever reaches it. It discovers its
//! node's assigned work the way a synced RESIDENT already does — by asking the
//! saga module's COMMITTED projection (`SagaQuery::AssignedPending`) for the
//! exact [`WorkerRequest`]s the effect lane would have carried — except the
//! query rides `/v1/query` instead of an in-process `Host`.
//!
//! Each pass offers new assignments to the off-loop [`compute_service::DispatchPool`]
//! ONCE and submits whatever follow-up ops are due. A pass NEVER awaits a
//! provider: the gate verdict is inline and immediate, the CLI runs on a spawned
//! task, and its result re-enters through [`WorkPump::completed`].
//!
//! ## exactly once, across a lossy read
//!
//! The chain is the source of truth, so a missed hint DELAYS work but never
//! loses it. The converse — treating a failed read as an empty projection —
//! would be far worse: emptiness retires entries, and retiring a live attempt
//! re-offers it as fresh work (a second child process for the same paid call,
//! and a computed-but-unsent result silently dropped). So:
//!
//! - an unreadable projection is not an empty one: the pass does nothing;
//! - plain absence needs a CONFIRMING second read before an entry retires;
//! - authoritative supersession (terminal saga, a higher attempt, a changed
//!   assignee) retires on the first read, and cancels the local run;
//! - the pump's own latch — not the pool's in-flight map, which prunes at
//!   delivery — is what keeps a still-pending attempt from being re-offered.
//!
//! A restart re-runs at worst once; the saga module's result singularity
//! collapses the duplicate.
