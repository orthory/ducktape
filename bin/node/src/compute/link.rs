//! the daemon's live ws attachment to its node: work-intake hints in, run
//! output out, on ONE connection.
//!
//! Two seams share it, because both are "this daemon and its node, continuously":
//!
//! - **hints.** The node sends a `heartbeat` frame on every block wake AND on a
//!   timer, so an unsubscribed connection is already the changed-hint feed —
//!   no topic, no cursor, no catch-up. Each hint wakes one intake pass; the
//!   daemon's own slower timer is the backstop that makes a dropped socket a
//!   DELAY rather than a stall.
//! - **run output.** The in-process `OutputSink` that used to feed the node's
//!   run-output ring cannot reach it across a process boundary; a `run_output`
//!   client frame is that sink, on the connection already open.
//!
//! A dropped socket is ordinary (the node restarts, the operator upgrades): the
//! task reconnects forever, logging attempt 1 and every Nth with an `attempts`
//! field. An unconditional warn here would be a log bomb on a node that stays
//! down — and the counter IS the diagnosis.
