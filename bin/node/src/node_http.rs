//! The operator CLI's thin HTTP client for a node's `/v1` surface: one
//! `submit`, one `submit_frame` and one `query` primitive, shared by every
//! `user`/`account`/`agent` verb so the `{target, payload}` / `{target, query}`
//! shapes and the receipt/error handling live in exactly one place instead of
//! being re-inlined per verb.
//!
//! `/v1/submit` is the frameless lane: it stamps the NODE's key as the op
//! origin, so only node-authored ops (announces, node-level governance) go
//! there. Every USER-authored op — an identity, gateway or saga op that must be
//! attributed to an account — is a frame the user key signed, POSTed verbatim
//! to `/v1/submit/frame`; its verified signer is the op's origin. `/v1/query`
//! reads committed module state.

/// ONE blocking client for this process's whole `/v1` lane.
///
/// `reqwest::blocking::Client::new()` is neither free nor infallible: each one
/// spawns its own tokio runtime on its own thread with its own connection pool,
/// and it PANICS when the build fails. Under `EMFILE` that is how a descriptor
/// shortage became a dead `announce-watch` thread — the watcher builds three
/// clients per 10 s tick, so it was the first thing in the process to ask the
/// kernel for a descriptor it could not have, and it asked through a `.expect`.
/// One client, built once and reused, also keeps the loopback keep-alive
/// connection instead of dialing a fresh socket per request.
///
/// A failed build is NOT cached: it is transient by nature (that is what EMFILE
/// is), and a poisoned lane would outlive the shortage that caused it. Two
/// racing builds are possible and harmless — the loser is dropped.
