//! Module-code distribution over the WireGuard data plane.
//!
//! Consensus commits WHICH code a module runs as a 32-byte hash (the modules registry);
//! this plane moves the content-addressed BYTES — wasm components today,
//! quack capsules tomorrow. Two stream intents, both self-verifying (the
//! receiver publishes a blob only when the assembled whole re-hashes to the
//! digest, so no trust ever attaches to which peer the bytes came from):
//!
//! - PUSH: the staging custodian fans a new artifact out to every member
//!   BEFORE the governance proposal referencing its hash is submitted. The
//!   receiver acks with its resume offset (transfers survive drops), streams
//!   the tail into a disk-staged slot, and answers one result frame.
//! - PULL: a node missing a committed artifact asks a peer to stream it —
//!   the data-plane twin of the mesh's ranged blob lane.
//!
//! Admission is default-deny per the plane's contract: members only, one
//! live transfer per digest, [`MAX_INBOUND_PUSHES_PER_PEER`] concurrent
//! pushes per peer, per-kind size caps, and a process-wide staging byte
//! budget — a rogue member can waste bounded disk, never poison a blob. An
//! admitted push that stops delivering bytes is reaped at
//! [`RECEIVE_IDLE_TIMEOUT`], so silence costs a peer its seat.
//! What a dropped transfer leaves behind is bounded too: an abandoned partial
//! is resumable for [`blobstore::STAGING_RESUME_WINDOW`] and then swept.
