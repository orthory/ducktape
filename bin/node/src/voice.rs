//! The node's live-call runtime: the bridge between huddle websockets
//! (`noded`'s `/v1/call/ws` typed audio+video+control socket), the chat voice
//! engine + video wire, and the p2p mesh.
//!
//! Runtime shape mirrors the reachability plane's split exactly: the hub runs
//! on its OWN plain-tokio OS thread (the engine's pump and the 20 ms playout
//! tick are tokio-native). On that thread it binds the per-service overlay
//! media planes ([`crate::voice_plane`]) and serves sessions over them —
//! audio + call control on `Service::Voice`'s overlay socket, camera video on
//! `Service::Video`'s. Distinct overlay ports mean the two streams never share
//! a socket or a send queue, so a video keyframe burst can't starve voice (the
//! failure the mesh-encapsulation arm this replaced was prone to — see
//! [`crate::voice_plane`]). Media rides ONLY the overlay: no overlay, no media.
//!
//! Three pieces, all off-consensus:
//! - Two per-use [`DataPlane`]s over the overlay ([`crate::voice_plane`]),
//!   built lazily once the reachability plane has the interface up.
//! - An [`AdmissionPolicy`] over the node's ACTIVE flows, keyed by
//!   `(Service, FlowId)` and carrying each flow's ROSTER: this node receives
//!   (and emits) call media only for flows its own operator has a live huddle
//!   session on — the mic and control flows on `Service::Voice`, the camera
//!   flow on `Service::Video` — and only from/to peers the session's
//!   `recipients` watch lists. The overlay authenticates every peer by its
//!   source `/128` (identity); the roster is the authorization on top: flow
//!   ids are derivable from public channel ids, so without it any network
//!   member could inject media into a call it is not part of. Unadmitted
//!   traffic drops counted at the plane per its default-deny contract.
//! - The hub loop — drains [`noded::RealtimeSessionRequest`]s from the app
//!   surface and runs one huddle plus one Pages-presence session at a time.
//!   A huddle owns a [`VoiceEngine`] on the channel-derived audio flow plus
//!   datagram flows for camera video and call control, and
//!   pumps: websocket pcm in → encode + fan-out; a 20 ms tick → mixed playout
//!   → websocket out; captured camera frames → fragment + fan-out; inbound
//!   fragments → reassemble → webview; and the call-control machinery
//!   (keyframe requests, 1 Hz presence beacons, the sender/receiver bitrate
//!   ladder). Pages presence owns one lean control flow and does not disturb
//!   the huddle. Dropping a webview tears down its session; a new request of
//!   the same kind replaces the current one.
