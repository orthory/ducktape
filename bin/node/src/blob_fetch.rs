//! the blob mesh lane: the SERVE half answering `SyncRequest::Blob` /
//! `BlobInfo` / `BlobRange` from this node's store, the demux that keeps a
//! peer's frames and our own straight, and the REQUESTER that assembles a
//! large blob from ranged windows.
//!
//! the original single-shot requester (`MeshBlobFetcher`, the #298 prompt
//! lane) was deleted when agent personas became duckfs skills. the requester
//! is BACK for the wasm code plane: consensus commits a module's component
//! (or quack capsule) by 32-byte hash, the bytes travel out-of-band, and a
//! node that lacks the committed bytes at a swap boundary, during replay, or
//! at state-sync catch-up fetches them here — [`fetch_blob`] discovers the
//! length ([`SyncRequest::BlobInfo`]), streams bounded windows
//! ([`SyncRequest::BlobRange`]) into a resumable [`blobstore`] staging slot,
//! and publishes only when the assembled whole re-hashes to the digest, so
//! no trust attaches to which peer answered. misses rotate the source and a
//! failed node stays failed-closed — it can never fork.
//!
//! two request paths share this machinery: joiners/catch-up own a
//! [`statesync::p2p::P2pSyncClient`]; a validator's statesync channel
//! receiver is owned by its serve loop, so it fetches through the
//! [`ServeLaneBlobClient`] co-client — sends ride a clone of the serve
//! lane's sender and responses route back through [`classify_mesh_frame`]'s
//! pending-map demux.
