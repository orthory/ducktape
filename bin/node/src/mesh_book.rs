//! the mesh transport's ADDRESS BOOK: `ed25519 key → commonware Address`,
//! with tiered precedence — the application-side replacement for
//! discovery's address gossip now that the mesh rides `authenticated::lookup`
//! (addresses are supplied by the application, never learned on the wire).
//!
//! ## tiers, strongest first
//!
//! 1. **live advert** — a signed reachability record's control endpoint,
//!    observed by the running plane ([`MeshAddressBook::observe_advert`]).
//! 2. **operator hint** — a resolved config dial hint (descriptor
//!    `reach`/`bootstrap` routes, invite-injected ULA routes, dev-shape
//!    `peer_addrs`). TWO EXCEPTIONS, both in the named predicate
//!    `advert_is_pinned_out`:
//!    - a DNS hint outranks live adverts — per-dial re-resolution is
//!      deliberate operator config (the sentry doctrine), and an advert would
//!      freeze it to one stale resolution.
//!    - an advert whose endpoint only carries INSIDE ITS AUTHOR'S OWN NETWORK
//!      (RFC1918 / loopback / link-local / CGNAT — `first_contact_join::
//!      ip_is_unroutable_offnet`) never displaces an address that IS this
//!      peer's overlay ULA, whether that came from the invite-injected hint
//!      or from the derived fallthrough. A member's advert carries its
//!      `advertised` (default: its `listen`, on a LAN literally
//!      `192.168.0.151:9020`), which says where the member IS, never whether
//!      THIS node can get there; the overlay is reachable from anywhere one
//!      tunnel hop away. A GLOBALLY ROUTABLE advert still wins — that is the
//!      direct path, and the whole reason adverts are observed — and so does
//!      an advert that is itself this chain's overlay (`advertised =
//!      "overlay"`), which carries the live port.
//! 3. **persisted advert** — a mesh-state.json control endpoint from a
//!    previous run; never displaces an operator hint (a possibly-dead
//!    persisted address must not shadow a live operator-provided one).
//! 4. **derived fallthrough** — no entry at all: the peer's overlay ULA at
//!    the default mesh port, a pure function of `(namespace, key)`. this
//!    makes [`MeshAddressBook::addressed`] TOTAL: lookup tracks no peer
//!    without an address, and an undialable derived ULA still keeps the KEY
//!    in the tracked set, so the peer's own inbound dial is accepted
//!    (`bypass_ip_check` + key-in-tracked-set) — the dev-shape joiner, the
//!    endpoint-less coordinated member, and the pre-tunnel overlay member
//!    all connect through their own dials.
