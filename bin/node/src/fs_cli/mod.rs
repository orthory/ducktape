//! `ducktape fs` — the duckfs working-copy CLI.

//! a clap-derive verb tree (the workspace adopted clap 4.6; the old "no clap"
//! prohibition is dead) over the `duckfs-client` engine and its `HttpNode`
//! transport. it ships the read verbs and the working-copy loop
//! (checkout/status/commit/pin). the FUSE `mount` verb was removed in the
//! 2026-07-13 storage-plane revision (see the duckfs spec's Mount surface
//! section; the implementation lives in git history at e7b4e1d1 if genuine
//! mount demand ever returns).
//!
//! exit codes are part of the contract: 0 success, 1 an operational failure (and
//! a dirty `status`), 2 a usage error (clap owns these, at the top-level parse)
//! and a commit conflict.
