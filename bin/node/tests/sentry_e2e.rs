//! sentry-fronted entry over real sockets: a validator advertises ONLY a
//! transparent TCP forwarder (a "sentry") in front of it — its real listen
//! port is never handed to any peer — and an out-of-mesh joiner still enters,
//! syncs, and promotes entirely through that pipe.
//!
//! this is the tightest proof of the Phase-1 sentry pattern: a network of ONE
//! (`Cluster::new(&[0], &[0])`) has quorum 2-of-2 only after the friend joins,
//! so consensus finalizes an op founder<->friend ONLY if the joiner reached
//! node 0 — and the joiner can reach node 0 ONLY via the sentry (its config
//! lists members by KEY only; its sole address for node 0 is the sentry). A
//! connection counter on the pipe confirms the joiner's entry traffic actually
//! transited the forwarder.
//!
//! the sentry is pure `std::net`/`std::thread` (no new dependency, matching the
//! harness idiom): a `TcpListener` accept loop that, per connection, dials the
//! target and splices both directions with `std::io::copy`. it counts BRIDGED
//! CONNECTIONS, not bytes — the mesh connection is long-lived, so a byte tally
//! taken at connection close would race the assertion, whereas a connection
//! count is settled the moment a client is bridged.
