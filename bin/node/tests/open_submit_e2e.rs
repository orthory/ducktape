//! the OPEN submit door, end to end over the relay lane: a fresh user key —
//! holding NO standing of any kind, granted nothing by anyone — signs chat
//! ops and submits them through a joined RESIDENT's `/v1/submit/frame`. the
//! resident relays the frames to the founder validator, whose door admits any
//! validly signed external frame: the signature is the WHOLE gate, the same
//! contract as a validator's local HTTP lane. the ops commit, and chat
//! records the frame's verified signer as the author.
//!
//! this pins the contract that replaced the client-standing plane: submitting
//! needs no invite, no grant, no ceremony — per-module authorization is
//! decided at dispatch (the acl module's policy, allow-all by default, plus
//! each module's own origin checks), never at the transport door.
//!
//! run alone (cluster e2es flake under parallel load):
//!   cargo test -p node-bin --test open_submit_e2e -- --nocapture --test-threads=1
