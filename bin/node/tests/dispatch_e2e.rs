//! live multi-node dispatch e2e: REAL `ducktape` validators over
//! localhost TCP, with REAL script-backed providers wired through the full
//! capability-host path (operator spec dir -> discovery -> announce ->
//! resolve -> spawned CLI), driving the whole agent loop across nodes:
//! mention -> engagement -> dispatch -> saga -> provider execution on the
//! RIGHT node -> oracle result -> next-block delivery -> one chat reply.
//!
//! two scenarios, two clusters:
//!
//! - `mention_routes_to_the_announced_provider_across_nodes`: heterogeneous
//!   providers on two different validators (a `text` executor on node 1, a
//!   `json-result` executor on node 2), each announced into the capability
//!   registry from its own host. a mention of an agent bound to each tag
//!   executes on exactly the node that provides it — however the op entered
//!   consensus — and replies exactly once, one block (or more) after the
//!   result committed (the never-pop-stack rule, observed via the op index).
//!
//! - `unannounced_capable_nodes_race_accept_and_execute_once`: both provider
//!   validators run a compute grant announcing nothing (accept-lane-only), so
//!   the agent's tag has an EMPTY rendezvous pool and the dispatch's
//!   WorkerRequest goes out UNASSIGNED — an announcement. both capable nodes
//!   race `SagaMsg::Accept`; consensus order seats exactly one winner and the
//!   loser's accept finalizes as a deterministic no-op.
//!
//!   What the assertions PROVE is narrower than "the work runs once": at most
//!   one `OracleResult` op commits PER ATTEMPT, which rules out two nodes both
//!   believing they won one claim. It does not rule out a node that lost its
//!   lease mid-run finishing and paying for the work anyway — that gap is a
//!   product guard (the cancellation check between podman `create` and `start`,
//!   held by a source lint in `provider-host`), not something committed state
//!   can show, because the late result lands as a no-op.
//!
//! ## the compute plane is a real, sandboxed, out-of-process one
//!
//! Both scenarios run each node's `ducktape service run compute` daemon beside
//! it and execute the provider INSIDE a container, because that is the only
//! compute plane there is. Two consequences shape the fixture:
//!
//! - every node needs a `[sandbox]` table. Without one the daemon exits at boot
//!   (`no [sandbox] table in node.toml`) and there is no compute plane at all —
//!   which is exactly the state this suite was silently in, passing nothing and
//!   failing three minutes later on an unrelated predicate. [`boot`] now gates
//!   on each daemon's own serving marker, so a dead one is named immediately.
//! - a host path is not a shared surface any more. The old exactly-once evidence
//!   was an `exec.log` each script appended to; inside a container's mount
//!   namespace that path does not exist. The count moved onto the chain, where
//!   it is a stronger claim anyway — see [`results_per_attempt`].
