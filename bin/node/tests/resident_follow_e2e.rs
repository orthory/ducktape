//! re-arms the serve window's fallback tick, so at the moment an adoption is
//! OBSERVED the next fallback-driven manifest fetch is a full
//! `RESIDENT_FALLBACK_POLL` (12s) away — minus only the probe loop's small
//! observation lag. a post finalized right after that observation can
//! therefore only appear in the resident's LOCAL reads within the 8s window
//! if the cert-lane wake fired. two consecutive legs, each re-anchored by the
