//! Every path that composes a Host from a MANIFEST must set its committed
//! clock, guarded at the source.
//!
//! `Host::query_as` answers an authenticated read against the last committed
//! block's height and consensus time. Replay advances that clock by re-applying
//! blocks; the two manifest paths — a checkpoint reopen (`restore_host`) and a
//! statesync install (`sync_all_modules`) — jump straight to a boundary and
//! apply nothing, so each has to set it explicitly.
//!
//! Miss one and the node answers its first authenticated reads with
//! `consensus_time = 0`. At zero, every `now < expires_at` check reads as
//! "nothing has expired yet" — fail-open, for as long as it takes the next
//! block to commit after a restart.
//!
//! Why a source lint and not a behavioural test: `restore_host` and
//! `sync_all_modules` are `pub(super)`, so a test crate cannot call them, and
//! exercising them for real means booting a node against a checkpoint — a full
//! e2e. The unit tests in `crates/kernel/host/tests/query_reader_context.rs`
//! prove what `restore_committed` DOES; only this proves it is CALLED. Deleting
//! either call site fails this test, which is the mutation that matters.
//!
//! `genesis_host` is deliberately absent from the rule: genesis has applied
//! nothing, so `(0, 0)` is the truth there rather than a missing call.
