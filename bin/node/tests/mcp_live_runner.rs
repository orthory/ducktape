//! the FULL-STACK live proof: a real runner CLI, driving the real
//! `ducktape mcp` binary, against a real node — and consensus refusing the write
//! it tries to make.
//!
//! the chain under test is the whole one: `claude` spawns the server from the
//! capability spec's own argv, the model calls its tools, the server signs a
//! `RunsMsg::AgentAction` frame with the run's session key, the frame crosses the
//! real router into the real `runs` module — which says NO, because the key is
//! bound to no live run. the agent HOLDS `tasks.create`; the grant is not what
//! stops it. the session gate is. a task appearing on the chain here would mean
//! that gate can be walked straight past.
//!
//! (the positive case — a bound session's write landing as `AuthorRef::Agent` —
//! is proven in `runs`'s own collaboration_loop e2e, which is the only harness
//! with a real dispatch and a real committed lease to bind against.)
//!
//! `#[ignore]` by design. it shells out to `claude`, which needs a logged-in
//! CLI, network, and money — none of which belong in a gate that must be green
//! on every machine. but the thing it proves is the one thing no other test in
//! this crate can: that the capability spec's argv actually makes a RUNNER
//! spawn our server and let the model call it.
//!
//! run it deliberately:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test -p mcp-bin --test live_runner -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! keep the argv below in lockstep with `capability-host`'s claude spec — the
//! test is worthless if it proves a different command line than the one
//! production runs.
