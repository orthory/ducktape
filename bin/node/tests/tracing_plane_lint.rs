//! The allowed set of logging planes, held in source.
//!
//! An event's `ducktape::<plane>` target is an operator's filtering handle:
//! `RUST_LOG=ducktape::join=debug` has to light up one plane that spans several
//! crates. That only works while a plane has ONE spelling. The networking area
//! once carried four — `netstack`, `overlay`, `plane`, `dataplane` — for what an
//! operator calls one data path, so turning "the overlay" up meant knowing all
//! four names, and none of them appeared in any list.
//!
//! `PLANES` below IS the list: there is no doctrine document, and the prose that
//! merely described the convention is what let the spellings drift. Adding a
//! plane means adding a line here that says what it covers; a plane nothing logs
//! to any more loses its line. Both directions are asserted, so the const cannot
//! rot into fiction.
//!
//! It lives here, in the node binary's tests, because the set it guards is
//! tree-wide and node-bin is the crate that links the whole tree: there is no
//! workspace-level test crate to hold it, and a copy per crate would be the
//! same drift in a new place. The cost is real and accepted — deleting the last
//! event of a thin plane (`broker`, `stream`) from some other crate turns
//! node-bin red, and the fix is a line in `PLANES` here.
