//! Regression e2e for parked-joiner mesh stability.
//!
//! Historically (under `authenticated::discovery`) a resident that tracked a
//! DIFFERENT set composition than the founder at a shared index was killed on
//! a bit-vector length mismatch every gossip round — churning the mesh and
//! dropping in-flight statesync. The transport is `authenticated::lookup`
//! now: there is no shared wire artifact left to disagree over, and the
//! tracked window is derived from replicated state on every node. What can
//! still go wrong — and what this test pins — is the tracking discipline
//! itself: a node whose window-sync re-tracked an existing generation index
//! (or regressed one) is silently warn-dropped by commonware, leaving its
//! mesh view stale exactly like the old bug did.
//!
//! This drives the REAL product join flow with `commonware_p2p=debug` on the
//! resident and asserts that after several quiet rounds at the post-grant
//! generation it logged ZERO tracker rejections — the direct health signal
//! of the generation-window discipline on a long-lived link.
//!
//! run alone (cluster e2es flake under parallel load):
//!   cargo test -p node-bin --test resident_peerset_stability_e2e -- --nocapture --test-threads=1
