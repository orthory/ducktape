//! statesync fail-closed — the server half: a validator refuses
//! statesync/manifest service to any key WITHOUT committed standing (validators ∪
//! residents), so a valid targeted invite alone leaks ZERO chain state.
//!
//! The decisive fact this pins is that TRANSPORT reachability is NOT enough:
//! mesh admission and committed standing are separate facts — a peer the mesh
//! authorizes may hold no standing at all — so a transport gate cannot tell
//! them apart. Enforcement is a REQUEST-LEVEL real-key proof
//! checked against committed standing. This test drives a peer that is EVEN MORE
//! privileged than an invite holder — its key is in the founder's descriptor
//! mesh (`peer_seeds`), so the mesh authorizes it and it CONNECTS — yet it holds
//! no committed standing (not a validator, not a resident). It attempts a real
//! `--sync-only` manifest fetch and is REFUSED every time: it connects, retries,
//! and never obtains a boundary. An invite holder (not even in the descriptor
//! mesh) is refused a fortiori.
//!
//! The two must-not-break directions — the restore path (a validator restart:
//! `restart_e2e`) and an admitted resident's boundary pre-sync
//! (`live_admission_e2e`) — dial under REAL keys that ARE in committed standing,
//! and their own suites prove they still sync. Here we assert only the refusal
//! the fail-closed gate newly imposes.
