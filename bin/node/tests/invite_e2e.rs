//! invite-after-genesis over real sockets: an UNINVITED key becomes a live
//! validator with zero config edits and zero member restarts.
//!
//! the flow under test (two humans, three commands):
//!   friend starts an out-of-mesh node        -> it parks, refused by the mesh
//!   a member runs `promote <pubkey>` (direct) -> governance passes, valset Join
//!   the epoch cutover re-tracks the mesh     -> the parked node syncs at the
//!                                                boundary, fabricates its
//!                                                recovery checkpoint, reboots,
//!                                                and votes in the new epoch
//!
//! two scenarios, two distinct promotion paths:
//! - `solo_founder_invites_a_friend`: n=1 -> 2. epoch 1 cannot finalize until
//!   the friend arrives (quorum 2 of 2), so the boundary freezes AT the epoch
//!   base — the joiner spawns on the epoch's genesis floor.
//! - `live_quorum_admits_a_fourth_validator`: n=3 -> 4. the three incumbents
//!   keep finalizing past the cutover (quorum 3 of 4), so the joiner syncs a
//!   mid-epoch boundary and needs the served finalization floor certificate.
