//! busy-chain ascension, end to end on the network-shape cluster: a resident

//! floor certificate certifies EXACTLY the current tip. on an idle chain the
//! tip parks and the gate trivially aligns; on a busy chain the floor must
//! keep re-aligning with a moving tip every drain — the seam this test
//! exercises. the live failure shape: a workspace under sustained write load

//! forever, because the floor persistence was gated on a momentarily EMPTY
//! finalization inbox — an instant that (nearly) never comes under load. the
//! gate mechanics are pinned by unit tests in the consensus crate
//! (`a_released_views_certificate_stays_persistable_while_newer_certs_arrive`);
//! this test guards the full serve path under sustained load.
//!
//! the ceremony itself (invite, join, grant) runs IDLE — governance ops need
