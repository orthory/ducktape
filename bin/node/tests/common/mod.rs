//! process-level harness for the real-socket node e2e: spawns REAL
//! `ducktape` binaries (via `CARGO_BIN_EXE_ducktape`) with generated
//! toml configs, drains their output into a feed it waits on for the node's
//! greppable markers, and speaks the json-lines rpc — the rust replacement for
//! what `demo-2node.sh` used to orchestrate in bash.
//!
//! shared by several test binaries, each using a different subset of the
//! helpers — the per-binary dead-code lint would otherwise flag whichever
//! helpers this particular binary skips.
#![allow(dead_code)]
//!
//! the constraints this harness encodes (they are invariants of the node, not
//! choices of the tests):
//! - every process needs a DISTINCT storage root (qmdb + the simplex journal
//!   persist; shared roots corrupt each other) — one tempdir per cluster.
//! - nothing supports port 0, so ports are pre-allocated by binding the whole
//!   batch simultaneously and then releasing it.
//! - the namespace is unique per cluster so a stale process from an earlier
//!   run can never handshake its way into this mesh.
//! - `converged root_hash=` latches after ANY `validator_seeds.len()` frames
//!   apply — it is a liveness marker, not proof of specific ops; state
//!   assertions go through rpc queries instead.
