//! Embeddable deterministic sim node.
//!
//! [`boot`] composes the same node the `ducktape-simnode` binary serves —
//! noded's full `/v1` router plus the `/sim/*` determinism lane — on
//! caller-owned storage and a caller-chosen listen address (`:0` for
//! ephemeral), running on private background threads so an embedder needs no
//! tokio runtime. It returns a synchronous [`SimHandle`] (`step`, `set_auto`,
//! `peer_block`, `state`, `wait`, `shutdown`) and installs NO process-global
//! side effects unless `SimOpts::install_log` is set. The binary is a thin
//! `main` over this.
//!
//! the deterministic scenario node: noded's exact /v1 http+ws wire over a
//! test-scripted block producer.
//!
//! same two-runtime shape as noded — the (non-Send) `host::Host` lives on its
//! own actor thread inside a commonware runner, axum serves on the main
//! thread — but the actor answers to TWO channels: the [`NodeCommand`] lane
//! every client dials, and a `/sim/*` control lane only tests use. the
//! semantic difference is WHEN blocks commit:
//!
//!   - hold mode (default): a submit is queued and its http reply retained —
//!     the request hangs, exactly like the networked validator's held submit —
//!     until `POST /sim/step` commits the next queued op as one block.
//!   - auto mode (`--auto` or `POST /sim/auto`): every submit commits
//!     immediately and drains its worker follow-ups, i.e. noded's behavior.
//!
//! block time is a LOGICAL clock (`SIM_EPOCH_MS + height * SIM_BLOCK_MS`) —
//! the one wall-clock read in noded's block path (`consensus_time`) is what
//! made replays non-reproducible, so the same op script always produces the
//! same root-hash here. reads (query/status) always serve committed state:
//! held ops are invisible until stepped, which is consensus semantics.
//!
//! the sim actor IS an [`OrderedNode`]`<`[`StepOrderer`]`, `[`NullSink`]`>` —
//! the SAME apply/drain/projection engine the validator runs, with a scripted
//! FIFO orderer (`/sim/step` releases one; auto releases each) and a logical
//! [`ConsensusTimePolicy::Epoch`] clock. a commit is flush → step-release →
//! `drain_delivered` → [`noded::projection::project_block`] — one shared block
//! path, no re-implemented row/index assembly. `NullSink` keeps the no-WAL
//! restart-from-index-watermark behavior.
//!
//! the blocks/index lane is the real daemons' exactly: every commit feeds the
//! durable block index (`BlockOps.record` via the shared `project_block`), so
//! `GET /v1/blocks` and `/v1/index/*` serve just like noded. personas shape
//! the one wire difference left between the two real nodes — the receipt:
//!   - `local`: submit receipts carry `op_hash` (the embedded daemon's shape).
//!   - `networked`: receipts are height-only — a response layer strips
//!     `op_hash`, the validator's shape until its ordered-node convergence.
//!
//! `POST /sim/peer-block` commits a block owned by no held submit — the
//! "concurrent writer" for optimistic-projection race scenarios. it takes
//! EITHER the single-op `{target, payload, origin?}` shape OR a multi-op
//! `{ops: [{target, payload, origin?}, …]}` shape: the ops array commits ONE
//! block with N members through the host's `submit_block` batch engine (per-op
//! isolation, one shared root-hash), and the reply carries a per-member
//! applied/rejected verdict so a test can pin the host's abort-all-and-replay
//! member isolation.
//!
//! signed-frame lane: `POST /v1/submit/frame` verifies exactly as the real
//! daemon does. it decodes the raw frame bytes with `node::decode_frame` — the
//! SAME codec every validator uses — and commits under the frame's VERIFIED
//! signer as `Origin::External`, with the same hold/auto semantics as the
//! frameless lane (a frame parks like any submit in hold mode; auto commits +
//! drains). the signer key is self-authenticating: verifying a frame needs no
//! mesh, no dispatch pool, no provisioner, so this lane is honest here in a way
//! `/v1/call/ws` (which needs a peer) is not. this is the one lane where
//! authorship is CRYPTOGRAPHIC rather than the trusted-client string
//! convention.
//!
//! `--node-key <64-hex>` fabricates a mesh identity for consensus-op scenarios
//! (huddle membership names a node key): `status().public_key` serves it back
//! instead of the empty default. no mesh sits behind it — the sim routes no
//! peer traffic; it is a value for state ops to reference. a key that is not
//! 32 bytes of hex fails loud at startup.
//!
//! genesis composition: the sim runs the SAME composer bin/node does
//! (`noded::compose::compose` over a `topology` selection), so every wasm tenant
//! is the REAL guest component — read from `--modules <dir>`, defaulting to the
//! founding set the build staged beside this executable, so a bare checkout
//! that built the sim boots with nothing installed.
//!
//! opt-in governance genesis: `--with-valset <hex-pubkey>[,<hex>...]` (comma-
//! separated, and repeatable) appends the kv/valset/acl/governance/modules
//! system modules AFTER the default 15, seeding the validator set with the given
//! genesis ed25519 keys exactly like bin/node. `--invite-binding <string>`
//! (default `"sim"`, meaningful only with `--with-valset`) sets the network
//! binding governance verifies invite tokens against. registering the upgrade
//! module makes the host's once-per-block boundary `Advance` ride every sim
//! block automatically, and it is also the code registry governance is wired
//! to — so `UpdateModule` proposals are live here, not gated off.
//!
//! origin hex escape (sim lanes only): a `/v1/submit` or `/sim/peer-block`
//! origin string prefixed `hex:` (e.g. `hex:ab12…`, any even-length hex)
//! decodes to RAW bytes before becoming `Origin::External` — the only way to
//! author as a real 32-byte ed25519 key (governance ballots key on it, and raw
//! pubkey bytes are not valid UTF-8). malformed hex after the prefix is a hard
//! request reject, never a silent fall-through to the literal string.
//!
//! honesty rules: no synthetic-rejection knob (rejection scenarios must use
//! genuinely rejectable ops, so module semantics stay real), no live LLM
//! worker (an external llm call in a determinism tool is a contradiction; the
//! echo worker behind `--echo-oracle` is the only oracle). storage should be a
//! fresh dir per run (the height resumes above the index watermark like
//! noded's, but reused module state defeats the same-script reproducibility
//! this tool exists for).
//!
//! run: `cargo run -p simnode -- [--listen <addr>] [--storage <dir>]
//!       [--auto] [--persona local|networked] [--echo-oracle]
//!       [--with-valset <hex>[,<hex>...]] [--invite-binding <string>]
//!       [--node-key <64-hex>] [--modules <dir>]`
//! — `--listen` defaults to [`DEFAULT_LISTEN`].
//!
//! block-on-reject (validator parity): a rejected SINGLE op JOURNALS a block
//! here, exactly like the ordered validator — the op rides the drain, seals its
//! height with a `rejected` explorer row, and the submitter still gets the
//! rejection reply. (this replaced the old `Host::submit_at`-aborts-pre-commit
//! behavior where a rejected single op minted no block.) a rejected MEMBER of a
//! batch is folded into that batch's one block with its own `rejected` verdict,
//! as before.
