//! the account-share governance lane plus two more `--with-valset` follow-ups
//! the four-PR campaign left queued, all driven deterministically over noded's
//! exact /v1 wire (no live roll). three things pinned here:
//!
//! - **account-share governance** (the last governance surface unexercised):
//!   validators adopt shares over two Identity accounts (numbers 1 and 2),
//!   which ALSO flips the electorate to account mode; a share-mode Signal is
//!   then decided by ParticipatingMajority over ACCOUNT-keyed ballots, honours
//!   its deadline, and — the load-bearing invariant — every proposal FREEZES
//!   its electorate, so one opened in share mode stays account-decided even
//!   after the mode flips back to validator ballots.
//! - **kv under the preset**: kv registers only with `--with-valset`; a
//!   set/get/overwrite round-trip, the no-delete reality, and a cheap
//!   same-script-same-hash determinism pass.
//!
//! every ballot is authored as a real principal: validators through the `hex:`
//! origin escape (governance keys their ballots on `Origin::External`), account
//! voters through a member key of the account — governance resolves that key
//! to its Identity account (`OfKey`), so the ballot principal is
//! `identity::account_principal(number)`, never the key.
