//! PID 1 inside a run's microVM.
//!
//! The seat `conmon` occupied under podman, and deliberately smaller: mount the
//! pseudo-filesystems and whatever block devices the host attached, read the
//! run manifest off the kernel command line, exec the agent CLI, carry its
//! stdout and stderr back over vsock as separate streams, report the exit code,
//! then halt the VM.
//!
//! Two things about being PID 1 shape the whole file:
//!
//! - **Returning from `main` panics the kernel.** Every path ends at
//!   [`halt`], including every failure path. A guest that dies without halting
//!   hangs its run until the host's idle timeout, holding all of its memory.
//! - **The HOST picks the halt method** (`DUCK_HALT=poweroff` on the kernel
//!   command line, or absent): the two VMMs are exact opposites about what
//!   ends a VM, and getting it wrong is a hang on one and a boot loop on the
//!   other — see [`halt`].

// Both halves of the host<->guest contract live in sandbox-host and are
// included here verbatim rather than depended on. The host has to ENCODE the
// manifest this parses and DECODE the frames this writes, so a second
// definition on either side is a wire-format fork waiting to happen — while
// PID 1 still must not carry tokio and tracing.
//
// Each end uses only part of each module (the guest parses manifests and
// encodes frames; the host does the reverse), so the unused part is dead code
// here by construction, not by oversight.
