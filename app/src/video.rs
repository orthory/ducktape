//! The huddle's video leg: capture → intra-only JPEG → the call socket's
//! video frames, and inbound peer frames → decode → the tile strip and the
//! stage.
//!
//! TWO SOURCES, ONE STREAM. A participant occupies one video flow and one
//! tile, and the beacon's `camera_on`/`sharing` pair says which of the two the
//! far end is looking at — so [`Source`] is one discriminant and starting
//! either source ends the other. The camera is a device (`nokhwa`); the screen
//! is the desktop: a root-window grab over X11 (`x11rb`, already in this
//! binary under winit — see [`ScreenSource`] for why not the portal), or the
//! main display through Core Graphics on macOS.
//!
//! CODEC v1 IS BASELINE JPEG, EVERY FRAME A KEYFRAME. The wire (ws
//! `media_service::call_wire` and the mesh fragmentation in `media_service::video`) treats the
//! encoded bytes as opaque and both ends of the webview leg are THIS app, so
//! the client picks the codec. Pure-Rust JPEG keeps the build free of C
//! toolchains on every platform; intra-only means a lost frame costs nothing
//! (the next one is a sync point), so inbound `KeyframeRequest`s are
//! meaningless and never sent. The codec itself is
//! `media_service::video::codec` — NOT this crate, because its two APIs are
//! generic and would instantiate here at the app's dev `opt-level = 0`, where
//! a VGA frame cost ~90 ms of encode, decode and channel swap and the loop
//! fell behind the camera (the "video latency" under `make dev`). The seam to
//! a delta codec (VP8/AV1) is that module and `store_peer_frame`; nothing
//! else knows JPEG exists. MAX_FRAME_BYTES on the mesh is ~129 KB; 640×480 at
//! q60 runs 30–60 KB.
// ponytail: fixed 640x480-ish @ q60, wire ≤60 fps, no rate-ladder response —
// ducktape is a private-network workspace app, so the generous ceiling is
// deliberate (q60 VGA at 60 fps ≈ 2-4 MB/s per sender); wire the RateHint →
// (fps, quality) ladder when a real WAN leg complains.
//
//! THREADING mirrors the audio leg: one OS thread owns the open source (the
//! nokhwa camera is not `Send`), follows the toggle, holds a source only while
//! it is the one asked for, and dies with the session's shutdown sender.
//! Decoded peer frames land in a global store the `call_video_tiles` and
//! `call_video_stage` extern components read; both are SELF-REDRAWING widgets
//! that repaint their own window at the capture cadence — no app message, no
//! view rebuild, no other window woken.
//!
//! EVERY FRAME IS A NEW RENDERER IMAGE, AND THE RENDERER FREES NOTHING ON ITS
//! OWN. `img(Arc<RenderImage>)` uploads a sprite-atlas tile per image id and
//! keeps it until `Window::drop_image`; a call that never called it grew the
//! atlas by a VGA tile per frame, ~36 MB/s, for as long as it ran. So the
//! store RETIRES every handle it replaces, and the surfaces drop the retired
//! ones on their next paint — the one place a `Window` is in hand.
