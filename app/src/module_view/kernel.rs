//! The kernel contract: what EVERY module view may ask of the app, with no
//! per-module code on this side of the wire. A view that speaks only this
//! contract is replaced by a module deployment alone — the app binary
//! never changes for it.
//!
//! - `rpc.query` `{target, query}` — one module query on the connected
//!   node, answered with the reply's JSON; `rpc.view` the same against
//!   the module's index-tier view.
//! - `rpc.blocks` `{limit}` — the recent block feed; `rpc.status` and
//!   `rpc.peers` the node's own status and peers JSON.
//! - `rpc.live` `<plane>` — a subscription that gets one item per block
//!   the app's live stream reports for that plane: a module's name
//!   ([`live_hit`], any module — an audited view is trusted to read what
//!   it names), or `block` for every block ([`block_hit`]), so the view
//!   re-reads what moved.
//! - `rpc.stream` `{topic, params}` — a subscription on ONE of the node's
//!   own event topics, opened over `/v1/ws` with `params` as the upgrade's
//!   query and the SEATED key as the proof on it. Every frame the node
//!   sends arrives as one item, byte for byte; the close is the item that
//!   ends it. The kernel reads neither the topic nor the frames — the node
//!   decides what this key may hear.
//! - `rpc.query_as_reader` `{target, query}` — the query AS THE SEATED
//!   KEY'S HOLDER (`/v1/query/reader`), for a module that serves protected
//!   content to its reader; refused while the key is locked.
//! - `files.get` `{lane, params}` — one `/v1/files/<lane>` read with its
//!   query-string params; `blob.get` `{digest, limit}` — a blob by hex
//!   digest, verified against it.
//! - `picture.load` `{surface, path}` — a duckfs file paged in, decoded and
//!   parked in a host picture surface's slot; answered with its drawn size.
//! - `files.stage` `<raw bytes>` / `blob.put` `<raw bytes>` — a duckfs
//!   chunk or a blob landed on the node, proven with the seated key;
//!   answered with the digest.
//! - `op.submit` `{target, payload}` — one module op, signed with the
//!   SEATED key and submitted; answered with the block height. The view
//!   never carries a password, an endpoint or a key.
//! - `rpc.admin` `{route, payload}` — one POST to a `/v1` route that
//!   mutates THE NODE rather than module state, signed with the SEATED key
//!   exactly as the `ducktape node` verbs sign theirs; answered with the
//!   node's own reply text, or its refusal. The kernel names no route —
//!   the node's operator gate decides what this key may ask for.
//! - `git.merge` `{target, repo, ours, theirs, message}` — the merge commit
//!   a git-backed module's wire demands the CLIENT compute, built with
//!   libgit2 against a bare mirror of the node's `/<target>/<repo>` remote
//!   and landed as a pack under the seated key; answered `{merge_oid,
//!   pack_digest}`, or `{conflicts}` and nothing written. No wasm guest can
//!   do this: it is a git implementation plus a second transport.
//! - `picture.put` `{surface, path, pages}` — base64 pages decoded, joined
//!   and parked as the picture the `picture` surface draws under `surface`;
//!   answered `{width, height}`. `picture.inline` `{doc, source, base, net}`
//!   — the pictures a Markdown `source` embeds, resolved against the
//!   document's own `duck://` address and parked under `doc` for the
//!   document surface. Both are the app's decoder and its one outbound
//!   picture gate, which a view has neither of.
//! - `host.badge` `<count>` — the tab badge, handed to the app as the
//!   `badge` event with `{"count": N}` in its detail; `host.roster`
//!   `{scope, members}` — the mention vocabulary of the host composer a
//!   view docked over `scope`.
//! - `host.id` `<prefix>` — one id, unique on this device, for a module
//!   whose records are addressed by ids its WRITER mints. A view has no
//!   clock and no entropy of its own, so the app mints it.
//! - `clock.ticks` `<period, i64 ms little-endian>` — a subscription that
//!   gets one item per period. A wasm module has no clock, so an Ice
//!   `every`/`repeat` in a view is this door; the window thread keeps the
//!   deadline and the shell draws the frame it comes due on.
//!
//! A query and a submit go to the node off the window thread, on the
//! kernel's own runtime, and their answers wait in [`Replies`] for the
//! view's next redraw; the widget polls while any is in flight.
