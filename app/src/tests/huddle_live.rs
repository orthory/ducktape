//! THE LIVE HUDDLE LANE — ignored by default, because it needs a live node, a
//! second person, and the camera and microphone this box may not have.
//!
//! Every other test of the huddle stops at a boundary: the unit suites run
//! pure folds, and the node's `huddle_media_e2e` drives two real nodes with a
//! client written for the test. This one is the app's OWN leg —
//! `backend::join_huddle`, `call::call_session`, its roster poll, its ws pump,
//! its capture thread, its decode store — run as ONE SIDE of a two-sided
//! huddle. The other side is another process (another machine, in the real
//! thing) doing the same.
//!
//! ONE PROCESS IS ONE PERSON, which is the whole reason this is not a
//! two-session test: identity is process-global (`DUCKTAPE_HOME`/
//! `DUCKTAPE_USER_KEY` name ONE user key), and it is the roster row matching
//! that key that a session filters itself out by. Two sessions in one process
//! are one person twice, which is not the arrangement that broke.
//!
//! IT ASKS FOR EVERYTHING A HUDDLE IS: the other side's presence beacon,
//! their picture in the store, and mixed frames with their voice in them. Two
//! of the three passing is the exact half-working call this whole session was
//! about — so one assertion covers all three, and the failure names which.
//!
//! `ops/huddle-lane.sh` stands the network up and prints the two commands.
//! Each side runs:
//!
//! ```text
//! DUCKTAPE_HOME=<side dir> DUCKTAPE_NODE=http://127.0.0.1:<http port> \
//! DUCKTAPE_HUDDLE_PASSWORD=<key password> DUCKTAPE_HUDDLE_CHANNEL=eng \
//! cargo test -p ducktape-app -- --ignored --nocapture huddle_live
//! ```
//!
//! `DUCKTAPE_HUDDLE_SOURCE=screen` publishes this side's DESKTOP instead of
//! its camera — the same one-flow, one-tile arrangement the share button
//! makes, so the far side names what it received by its size: a camera is
//! 640×480, a desktop is whatever that root window is, halved onto the tile
//! budget. It needs a real X display (`DISPLAY=:99` under Xvfb is one).
//!
//! It also prints how THIS side's own picture arrived — frames, mean gap,
//! worst gap. A preview averaging 30 fps with one 200 ms hole in it is the
//! stutter, and only the worst gap can see the hole.
