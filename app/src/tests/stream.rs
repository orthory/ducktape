/// A MIRRORED VIEW READING IS ONLY AS GOOD AS ITS WRITERS, SO THE WRITERS ARE
/// PINNED. These fields exist purely so the view stops paying for them —
/// sidebar rows, page-comment anchors, huddle tile mute readings,
/// `post_refusal`, and `active_dm` — because a
/// `sync` extern takes every list BY VALUE and a call in a view expression is
/// therefore a deep clone per frame (the room projection also ran a SHA-256 per DM
/// peer, twice a frame). The trade is real: a mirror that a writer forgets is a
/// sidebar listing DMs under CHANNELS, an unread dot that never lights, a
/// composer refused in a room she may post in, or a stranger's face over the
/// header — none of which any type checker can see.
///
/// So the rule is mechanical and checked here: a handler that assigns any of a
/// mirror's SOURCES assigns the mirror too. That is what makes mirroring
/// cheaper than the per-frame call instead of six chances to drift, and it is
/// the same shape as the caret-retire and room-mover lints above.
