//! The page document's markdown highlighter.
//!
//! Modelled on `ducktape-ui/examples/markdown-editor`: one `RichTextEditor`
//! over the whole document, and the SYNTAX ITSELF carries the formatting. A
//! line that starts `## ` is a Heading 2 because those three bytes are there,
//! not because a menu was opened — and the three bytes vanish unless the caret
//! is on their line, which is what makes the surface read as WYSIWYG instead of
//! as a source view.
//!
//! TWO THINGS THE REFERENCE DOES THAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT:
//!   * `pulldown-cmark` for the inline grammar. Pages must agree with the CHAT
//!     renderer, not with CommonMark — a `_word_` that italicises in a message
//!     has to italicise here. [`crate::editor::inline_marks`] IS that grammar,
//!     already tested against `chat::client::inline_spans`, so it is the parser
//!     for both surfaces and no dependency is added.
//!   * `iced_highlighter` language tokens inside fences. `PageBlock` carries no
//!     language field, so there is nothing to colour BY; a fence body is one
//!     mono plate.
//!
//! The line metrics are the Pages design tokens from `components/pages.ice`
//! (H1 20/1.25, H2 16/1.3, H3 14/1.35, body 14/1.65, quote 14/1.6, code 12/1.6,
//! callout 13/1.6), so a saved document reads at exactly the size it was typed.
