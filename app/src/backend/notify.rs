//! NATIVE DESKTOP NOTIFICATIONS for the two arrivals a person cannot afford to
//! find later: being `@mentioned`, and a direct message.
//!
//! Everything a mention produced before this landed inside the app — an inbox
//! row and the bell's unread count — which is worth nothing to a reader whose
//! window is behind an editor. The decision of WHETHER to notify is pure and
//! lives in [`desktop_notice`]; posting is one call on whichever notifier the
//! host offers, and only that call is untestable.
//!
//! "Behind an editor" is the app's own fact on every host: the window focus
//! events say whether any window of this app has focus, and the reducer
//! records their answer here ([`note_window_focus`]) for the live fold, which
//! runs beside the reducer and cannot read its state.
//!
//! THE NOTIFIER IS WHAT THE HOST OFFERS. On macOS it is the notification
//! center, which terminates a process that has no bundle identifier — and
//! `cargo test` is exactly such a process — so the bundle is checked before
//! the framework is touched, and a bare binary (`make dev`) says so ONCE at
//! boot and stays silent. Everywhere else it is the freedesktop notifications
//! service on the session bus; a host with no session bus degrades the same
//! way.
//!
//! THE HOST IS ASKED AT BOOT, not at the first mention. macOS prompts the
//! person once per bundle id and stores the answer; a request submitted while
//! the prompt is still up is refused (`UNErrorCodeNotificationsNotAllowed`),
//! and a stored "Don't Allow" refuses every request after it. Asking in
//! [`boot_desktop_notifications`] puts the prompt at launch, where the person expects it, and the
//! answer where they can read it: one log line per boot and the Settings tab
//! ([`desktop_notifications_host`]), which names what to do about a refusal.
