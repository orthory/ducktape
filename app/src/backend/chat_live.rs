//! An agent run anchored to a chat message, shown live in its thread
//! while it runs. The chain carries only the anchor and the committed reply;
//! the progress rides the node's `run-output:<dispatch>` topic, folded here
//! into a bounded row of status, activity titles and an answer preview. A row
//! lives exactly as long as its run is pending in `runs`: the entry prunes in
//! the block that posts the reply, so the committed message takes the row's
//! place.
//!
//! ONE READING PER NODE, NOT PER ROOM. Every pending run the node knows is
//! folded here and each row NAMES ITS ROOM, so which rows reach the screen is
//! a filter on `channel_id` (`module_view::encode_chat_props`) rather than a
//! stream that has to be torn down and relaunched on every room switch — the
//! eight handlers that move `active_channel` would each have had to remember
//! to, and the one that forgot would have drawn another room's runs.
//!
//! A reading is stamped with the CONNECTION it was taken over — endpoint, chain
//! id and connect attempt — because room ids are not unique across networks and
//! the endpoint is not unique across chains. A reading that crossed with a
//! reconnect is DROPPED by the handler (`live_agents_stale`), never assigned:
//! its emptiness describes a connection nobody is on, and writing it would
//! blank the cards the current one just installed.
