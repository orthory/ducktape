//! Where a network view comes from: the deployed artifact of the registry
//! entry it belongs to — a module's, whose frame may embed a view, or a
//! view-only entry's, whose frame IS the view. The registry names the
//! entry's kind and its ACTIVE code hash (`ModulesQuery::ModuleStatus`), the
//! artifact under that hash is fetched and verified (`view_artifact`), and
//! its view — component bytes plus the assets shipped beside them — is
//! handed over as one unit. The view drawn is the view of the code that
//! runs — unless the member is TASTING a proposed one: the taste set
//! ([`taste_set`]) is every `(module, hash)` an open `UpdateModule` /
//! `RegisterModule` proposal or a scheduled swap names, and a seat asked
//! for one of those hashes ([`resolve`] with a `wanted`) reads that frame
//! instead of the active one. Nothing on-chain moves for it.
//!
//! Every reading here is strict. A registry reply of another shape, a module
//! the registry does not list or lists twice, a hash that is not 32 bytes,
//! a fetch that fails or a body that does not hash to what was asked for is
//! an [`Error`], never a fallback to a desktop resource. The only quiet
//! outcomes are the two the network itself asserts: a module admitted but
//! not yet activated ([`ViewSource::NotActivated`]) and a verified
//! deployment that ships no view ([`ViewSource::Missing`]).
