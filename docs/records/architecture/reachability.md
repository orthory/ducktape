# The reachability plane

How a Ducktape node reaches its peers: the control mesh and the WireGuard data
tunnel it drives beside it, the invite that brings a joiner's tunnel up before
any TCP, and what heals from disk. The host half is
`crates/networking/reachability` (the executor, the rendezvous runtime, the
WireGuard keystore, sealed envelopes, the persisted-mesh store); the decision
core — the protocol state machine, per-epoch state, wire messages, derived
bindings, the persisted-mesh codec — is `crates/networking/netstack-machine`.
The signed record and handshake formats are
`../../records/protocols/wireguard-tunnel-upgrade.md`; the operator side is
`../../deploy/coordinator.md`.

## 1. Two planes, composed orthogonally

- The **control mesh** is commonware `authenticated::discovery` over TCP,
  key-authenticated end to end. The reachability plane never changes it: it
  exchanges its own messages over one dedicated mesh channel and drives only
  the data tunnel.
- The **data tunnel** is member↔member WireGuard on a dedicated, chain-scoped
  `dt-*` interface: per-epoch record gossip → signed advertisements → mesh
  view verification → pairwise handshakes → one interface configuration per
  epoch. `NatResolver` (STUN, rendezvous and hole-punch through the
  coordinator; no relay — a failed punch is terminal) resolves each peer's
  UDP endpoint.

Coexistence with a personal Tailscale is load-bearing: an `fd::/48` ULA
overlay derived from the chain id, and per-peer AllowedIPs of exactly one
/128 — never a default route, never `100.64.0.0/10`. Everything derives from
public inputs: overlay addresses from `(chain_id, identity)`
(`ula_v6_member_addr`), epoch bindings from `(chain_id, epoch, members)` — no
allocator, no coordination, no consensus-state change.

## 2. Transitive gossip

Reachability-plane messages never assume pairwise transport: records and
adverts flood with nonce dedup, handshake messages fan to every peer and relay
through stage-superseding per-pair slots, and every message authenticates by
its owner's content signature (`SignedEndpointRecord`, the handshake triple) —
never by the delivering link. A joiner with a single ingress link assembles
tunnels with every member through that one link.

## 3. Mesh over the tunnels

`advertised = "overlay"` makes a node advertise its chain-derived overlay ULA
at its mesh listen port (requires `listen = "[::]:<port>"`). Discovery gossip
distributes it; dialers retry until the tunnel makes it routable. A
`coordinated` reach hint routes the WireGuard path through its coordinator;
the overlay advertisement is how the TCP mesh follows.

## 4. Membership: registration → online → activation

Validator membership is two-phase. Governance `Join` registers a key as
STANDBY: transport-tracked, statesync-served, quorum-exempt, arming a
transport-only cutover. The parked node probes its registration from the
valset snapshot, proves a full state sync, and announces itself online over
the lobby with its own height-windowed signature; any active member relays the
proof (re-verified in-module), and the activation cutover widens the quorum. A
registered-but-absent node costs consensus nothing.

## 5. The tunnel-first invite

The invite blob IS the VPN credential, and the join window's carrier is the
invite tunnel itself — there is no TCP ingress at all.

1. A member runs `ducktape node invite`: the signed blob carries the network
   descriptor, the member's WireGuard public key and underlay UDP endpoint,
   its UDP intro endpoint (`invite_listen`, default the WireGuard port + 1),
   its overlay mesh port, an expiry, and a single-use token — minting IS the
   admission decision.
2. `ducktape node join <blob>` writes the workspace with WireGuard-shape
   defaults (own plane, dual-stack mesh listen, `advertised = "overlay"`, the
   inviter's overlay ULA as a direct dial hint) and the node starts: it
   installs the inviter as a join-window tunnel peer straight from the blob,
   announces its identity and WireGuard key to the intro listener (one
   token-authenticated datagram; the inviter installs the peer and acks with
   an `IntroAck`), and the tunnel comes up before any p2p.
3. The mesh dials the inviter's overlay ULA the moment the tunnel routes; the
   joiner's lobby announce rides it, and the receiving member submits the
   governance `Redeem` op automatically — no approval verb. The grant cutover
   re-tracks the mesh, the pre-warm layer (§7) assembles tunnels with every
   member, and the joiner syncs (rotating across every serving validator)
   into a serving full node.
4. Seating it in the quorum stays a separate, deliberate act
   (`ducktape node member promote`) — the machinery of §4, unchanged.

### Fronts: every path the inviter offers

The blob bundles EVERY entry the inviter offers as ONE candidate set:
`{inviter} ∪ {fronts}`, where each front is a reachable member the inviter
already meshes with, read from its persisted `mesh-state.json` at mint. A
front carries only:

- `member_key` — the member's real ed25519 node identity (the joiner
  authenticates this end-to-end);
- `wireguard_public_key` — the member's **public** X25519 key;
- `mesh_port` — the member's overlay control port;
- `endpoint` — the member's routable WireGuard underlay endpoint when it is
  host-capable, else `None` (a punchable, NAT'd member reached by identity
  through the joiner's coordinator).

No WireGuard **private** key is ever transported. The joiner races the whole
union: a candidate with an endpoint is dialed directly and announced at its
intro port; an endpoint-less one is driven through
`BootstrapCoordinatedInvitePeer` (rendezvous → install → intro over the
punched socket). The first `IntroAck.installed` wins, the rest are cancelled,
and exhaustion is an honest terminal: a distinct non-zero exit with a
mode-naming fatal, never a silent success. So a fully-NATed (including
symmetric) inviter still onboards as long as ONE offered path — itself via its
coordinator, or any reachable front — comes up.

The coordinator is AMBIENT: the joiner's resolver binds
`primary_coordinator_or_default` (the public default), never an address baked
into the blob; the invite embeds no coordinator address at all. Fronts live
OUTSIDE the genesis fingerprint (advisory reachability, not validator
identity — pinned by a fingerprint-exclusion test), so they never affect
consensus identity or which network a blob admits to. A first-boot inviter
with no persisted mesh (or one that holds only itself) mints an invite with no
fronts and prints a warning; the join still works over the inviter's own
paths — re-mint once the mesh has peers to widen the race.

Because the blob names the inviter's reachable members (identities, WireGuard
public keys, overlay ports, and public endpoints for host-capable ones), a
leaked invite widens who sees that data from admitted members to whoever
holds the blob. Invites are single-use and expire; treat one like the secret
it is (`../../deploy/backup-and-keys.md`).

Bounds by design: a DIRECT candidate's intro listener is the peer's own UDP
(`wg_port + 1`), so a direct path needs that member's port
underlay-reachable (one forwarded UDP port suffices; the joiner needs
nothing), while a coordinated path needs no forwarded port at all. The
TCP-carrier halves of the join are proven by
`bin/node/tests/join_request_e2e.rs`, and the whole ceremony on a live
overlay by `bin/node/tests/wireguard_tunnel_e2e.rs`.

## 6. Cold restart

A member restarting with zero TCP links (ingress gone, tunnels torn down at
exit) — and the whole-network cold start — heals from disk. Every applied
epoch persists its verified advert set (`<storage>/mesh-state.json`,
signature-verified on load); the first boot retarget re-applies that mesh
purely locally — peer WireGuard keys and advertised endpoints from the
persisted records, overlay ULAs re-derived from `(chain_id, identity)`, NATed
endpoints re-resolved FRESH through the coordinator (`NatResolver` needs no
gossip; one-sided resolution suffices because WireGuard roams on
authenticated inbound) — and the dialer is seeded with the persisted control
ULAs for peers without a configured hint. The restored mesh is purely a
gossip carrier: the boot epoch's own live assembly replaces it at its apply.
What it deliberately does NOT cover is the FIRST join (nothing persisted
yet) — that is the invite tunnel's job (§5).

## 7. Standby tunnel pre-warming

The plane's epochs version ACTIVE members only — a registered-but-absent key
must never stall an epoch — but the resident tier rides a separate PRE-WARM
layer with the opposite trade: never versioned, never handshaked, applied
live. Every retarget carries the epoch's resident set as standbys; a
standby's owner-signed endpoint record (bound to the epoch tuple,
policy-checked, nonce-superseded) installs a tunnel by re-applying the full
interface config in place — the same record-derived trust model as the
cold-restart restore — and a higher-nonce re-advertisement moves its endpoint
live. The parked joiner runs the plane in the standby role off its manifest
polls (its gossip is admitted under the derived lobby identity; replies route
back over the delivering transport key), installs every member on its own
interface, and persists the member adverts — so the promotion reboot restores
full connectivity from disk before the new epoch's assembly replaces it with
the verified mesh. A joiner's tunnels exist BEFORE its activation cutover, not
seconds after.

## 8. Rendezvous

The rendezvous plane holds up over real time and real NATs three ways.
Coordinator registrations EXPIRE (`REGISTRATION_TTL_SECS`): an expired key
resolves to an honest `None` and receives no `PunchSync` toward its dead
pinhole, and the nonce anti-rollback guard yields for corpses so a rebooted
node re-registers cleanly. Nodes hold their mapping with a keepalive
`Readvertise` every `RENDEZVOUS_KEEPALIVE` from the resolver's pump task —
the same datagram keeps the NAT pinhole open, and its wall-clock-seeded nonce
supersedes the node's own pre-reboot mapping. And the punch does not need both
sides to resolve simultaneously: the pump answers coordinator-vouched
`PunchSync` fan-outs while the node is otherwise idle, and the active side
re-`Lookup`s on every punch retry (each one re-fans the sync), so one-sided
resolution completes against an idle-but-alive peer.

Every rendezvous request carries proof of possession of the node key it
claims (`crates/networking/nat-traversal/src/auth.rs`); in private mode the
coordinator additionally admits only keys rooted in the network's genesis
set. A compromised coordinator can deny service and, for a pair with no
direct path, make itself their underlay relay — but it can never substitute
keys: records pin WireGuard keys under the owner's ed25519 signature, and the
tunnel payload stays end-to-end encrypted. There is no data relay in the
product, and this design needs none.

## 9. Proofs

- `crates/networking/reachability/tests/rendezvous_simnat.rs` — the
  production resolver punching over a simulated NAT topology.
- `bin/node/tests/join_request_e2e.rs` — the TCP-carrier halves of the join.
- `bin/node/tests/wireguard_tunnel_e2e.rs` — the tunnel-first invite end to
  end on a live overlay, two nodes in their own network namespaces: the
  `dt-*` interface up, the tunnel carrying at both members' ULAs, the mesh
  dial at the joiner's ULA, no kernel TCP listener on the mesh port on either
  side, and the joiner still folding blocks with every underlay TCP packet
  between them rejected. Skips where `ip netns` is unavailable.
- `crates/networking/wireguard/tests/tunnel_e2e.rs` — the fixed
  mesh-version vector every node must reproduce.
