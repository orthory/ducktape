# Indexable — the per-module materialized-view contract

Status: shipped — the wasm index-guest architecture: host-written op feed,
engine-folded read models (fluent31 changes-mode triggers), per-module view
guests, boundary stamps, and the join-seam op-row backfill. Since the read-model
cutover, this tier IS the human-facing read surface: canonical module
queries serve dispatch alone (§5).
Code: `crates/kernel/indexer` (the host store: feed writer + guest converge),
`crates/kernel/index-guest` (the contract + authoring SDK; `testmap` is the
reference mapper), the chat/tasks/pages/inbox/saga modules' `src/index.rs`
(pure decision cores) + `src/index_guest.rs` (wasm shells, packaged by
`guest-builder --index`), `bin/noded` (the feed, the HTTP lanes, the shared
store construction with bundled guests), `bin/node` (the validator: live
feed, replay feed, boundary stamps, the join-seam backfill), `crates/kernel/statesync`
(the `IndexOps` wire lane + the joiner-side walk).

## 1. Position: the derived tier

Ducktape state lives in two tiers with opposite contracts:

| | canonical tier | derived tier (this spec) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| substrate | qmdb / git — authenticated | fluent31 — ordered, scannable |
| in the root-hash | **always** (`Module::root()`) | **never** |
| cross-node | byte-identical by consensus | node-local, no determinism claim |
| reads | point lookups, module `query` | scans, search, partitions, views |
| consistency | exact at every height | **optimistic** — feed exact, views converge |
| crash story | replay / state-sync to the root | **rebuild** — replay the feed |

The canonical tier is deliberately not a database: `any::unordered` qmdb is
hashed keys and point lookups — no scans, no secondary indexes, no search.
Anything that needs those shapes is a *read model*, and read models are
derived: materialized from the finalized op stream, disposable by
construction, and invisible to consensus. Nothing a `root()` commits to may
ever live in — or be read back from — the derived tier.

NOTHING per-module is native on this tier. A module's mapper is wasm — like
its consensus logic — installed INSIDE its own index database and executed by
the engine. The node binaries hold zero per-module index code; that is what
lets an index-only node be a module-generic engine.

## 2. The two loops

The tier is two loops, coupled only through each module's database:

- **the host writer** (`IndexStore::apply_block`, called by the node's block
  loop): writes one borsh `OpRow` per applied dispatch under
  `op/{height:016x}/{seq:04x}` plus the watermark (`meta/height`), one atomic
  batch per module per block. No domain logic; this is the whole host side.
- **the fold** (the module's index guest): a fluent31 **changes-mode
  trigger** (`"fold"`) on the `op/` range delivers every committed op row to
  the guest's `on_apply` — exactly once, in commit order, the row inline up to
  the engine's inline cap (64 KiB). A larger row arrives key-only and the
  shell re-reads it from state, which is exact: op rows are immutable. The
  guest folds it into derived keys inside its own transaction: its writes and
  the event's consumption commit together (at-least-once invocation,
  exactly-once effects). Trigger-made writes never re-trigger; loops are
  impossible by engine construction.

The fold is ASYNC and OPTIMISTIC by design (the user's contract: "optimistic
now, consensus-consistent later"). The watermark vouches for the FEED alone —
"every block at or below H is fully in the feed" — and EVERY module's
watermark advances on EVERY applied block, so `watermark < H` always means
"blocks are missing", never "the module was quiet". Derived views trail the
feed by the trigger backlog, which is observable, never guessed:
`IndexStore::fold_status` (pending + last drain error) rides
`GET /v1/index/status` as `fold.{module}`.

Every module gets the feed, the watermark, and the backfill floor
(`meta/backfill`, §6) with zero module code. A module becomes **indexable**
by shipping an index guest.

## 3. The index guest

A module's mapper is a fluentabi module (core wasm32) installed under the
name `index` in the module's own database, with up to two roles:

- **fold** (`on_apply` export) — consumes the feed as above;
- **view** (`query` export) — the module's read projection, served read-only
  at one MVCC snapshot (`POST /v1/index/{module}/view`).

Ship both, either, or none: a fold-only guest maintains scan-served keys; a
module with no `query` role answers `ViewUnsupported` (§5). The store
converges each database on the bundled artifact at open — install
(overwrite-put; replacing bytes IS the upgrade path), trigger registration
when the guest folds, teardown of both when a module stops shipping one. A
converge marker (`meta/guest`: artifact hash + roles) written last makes a
warm boot free — a matching marker skips every wasm compile.

Because the guest lives in the database's engine keyspace, no wipe this tier
performs can touch it — `mark_backfilled`'s clear and `converge_guest`'s clear
both sweep only user keys. Every node installs its own mapper from its bundled
artifacts at open; nothing ships code over the wire.

### 3.1 Authoring shape: decide pure, write thin

A mapper is two files in the module crate:

- `src/index.rs` — the DECISION core, compiled everywhere: pure
  `fold_op(&OpRow, &impl StateRead) -> Result<Writes, Fail>` and
  `serve_view(&impl StateRead, &[u8]) -> Result<Vec<u8>, Fail>` over the
  `index_guest` contract crate (borsh `OpRow`, `StateRead` reads + paging,
  `Writes` command lists, the `search` posting helpers). Unit-tested
  natively against a plain `BTreeMap` — the map backend and `apply_to_map`
  are the test twins of the engine backend.
- `src/index_guest.rs` — the SHELL, behind the crate's `index-guest`
  feature: backs `StateRead` with the engine ABI (`EngineRead`), applies the
  decided writes, and exports the roles via `index_guest::fold!`/`view!`.
  The whole file is ~15 lines; `guest-builder --index` packages it into the
  committed `index.wasm` (`make wasm-modules` refreshes,
  `wasm-modules-check` guards presence and `make wasm-index-check` guards the
  bytes against a rebuild of the source).

Within one op a read never sees that op's own writes (they apply after the
decision); across ops in one feed batch it sees everything earlier — the
engine transaction and the native test harness agree on this by
construction. The decision core depends on exactly two internal things: the
`index_guest` contract crate and the module's crate-root wire types — never
the module's state machinery, never `sdk`/`host`/`indexer`.

### 3.2 Fold rules

1. **Applied ops only, all of them.** The feed carries exactly the
   dispatches consensus applied — root ops *and* follow-ups — in drain
   order. A failed op aborts its whole block and never reaches the feed.
   Mirror module semantics on that assumption (`tasks` files every
   `CreateTask` as `Open` because a duplicate create would have aborted;
   `chat` mirrors `head_seq` because every applied post assigned exactly the
   next sequence).
2. **Deterministic data-in/data-out.** No IO beyond the module's own index,
   no clock, no randomness — the fluentabi runtime enforces most of this
   (no WASI, no imports beyond the engine ABI, canonicalized floats, fuel).
3. **Fail loudly, never guess — but know what failure means.** A fold
   `Fail` holds the module's OWN queue: events are retained, the engine
   backs off and retries, `fold_status` surfaces depth and reason. It no
   longer poisons the store, and it no longer touches other modules. That
   cuts both ways: interface drift (an undecodable APPLIED op) should fail —
   the queue holds until a fixed guest ships, then folds on. But a
   DETERMINISTIC failure wedges the fold forever, so a mapper whose view is
   not worth a wedged queue (saga's billing ledger) documents skip-and-
   continue instead. Choose per mapper; write it down.
4. **Reserved namespaces.** `op/` and `meta/` are host-written; the trigger
   range spans `op/` alone, so bookkeeping writes never reach the guest.
   `fold/` is the SHELL's, written by `index_guest::guest::fold_batch` inside
   the fold transaction — today `fold/tip`, the `(height, seq)` of the last op
   row consumed, 12 bytes big-endian. A mapper's decision core must not write
   into any of the three (nothing enforces it engine-side — the prefixes are
   ordinary user keys there; the contract is this spec).

   `fold/tip` answers ONE question honestly: *has the fold consumed my op at
   `(H, seq)`* — read-after-your-own-write. It is not general freshness: it
   advances only on op traffic, so a quiet module's tip is arbitrarily old
   while its view is perfectly current (unlike `meta/height`, which bumps on
   every block). ABSENT is normal and means *unknown*, never height 0: a
   boundary stamp (§6) wipes it with the rest of the derived state, a fresh
   database has none, and a module that just gained its first index guest has
   folded nothing yet. So a client waiting on the tip must escape by timeout,
   never block on it.

   A mapper UPGRADE was once the hazard here — a swapped wasm left the tip
   PRESENT over the previous mapper's rows. It no longer is: `converge_guest`
   REFOLDS unconditionally on any artifact-hash change (clear the derived
   keyspace, re-drive the fold over the `op/` rows the database already holds,
   and WAIT it out before `open` returns), so a tip that survives an upgrade
   vouches for rows the installed mapper produced. `op/` and `meta/` are left
   alone: a new mapper changes what the rows MEAN, never what the feed saw.
5. **Pre-index history is out of scope.** An op referencing state the feed
   never carried (enabled mid-life, boundary stamp) folds to a no-op. The
   honest fixes are replaying the chain through the feed or pulling the
   source's real op rows below the boundary (§7) — never a guessed backfill.

### 3.3 View rules

1. **Module-defined wire, like `Module::query`.** Request and reply are the
   module's own JSON shapes (externally tagged enums by house convention);
   the daemon and the store treat both as opaque bytes. A guest `Fail`
   surfaces as the view error, message intact.
2. **One snapshot per call.** Every read of a view invocation sees the same
   MVCC snapshot, concurrent with both writers.
3. **Read-only.** The engine rejects writes in a `query` invocation
   (`EROFS`), and the role check happens at the boundary.
4. **Views may be absent.** `ViewUnsupported` is a first-class answer, not a
   failure — see §5.

## 4. The endpoints (noded)

Reads never cross the node-actor lane; they run on the HTTP runtime against
snapshots, like the blob and telemetry lanes.

| route | serves |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /v1/index/status` | per-module watermarks, backfill floors, fold health (backlog + last error), the poison flag |
| `GET /v1/index/{module}/ops?after=&limit=` | the feed, paged — borsh rows projected to the JSON envelope (`payload` when the payload is JSON, `payload_hex` otherwise) |
| `GET /v1/index/{module}/scan?prefix=&after=&limit=` | raw derived keys (debugging, generic consumers) |
| `POST /v1/index/{module}/view` | **the module's own endpoint** — its guest's `query` role |

A module with no guest (or a guest with no `query` role) answers 404 on
`view`.

## 5. The substrate doctrine — where reads live

The split is a DOCTRINE, not a per-module judgment call:

- **canonical state is authenticated point-read state, nothing more.** qmdb
  is used for what it is — hash-addressable records behind a merkle root.
  A module's canonical `query` surface exists FOR dispatch: the point and
  computed reads other modules' `execute()` paths (and the host) consume.
  Consensus can never read the derived tier, so those reads stay canonical
  by necessity — and they are the ONLY reads that do.
- **no scan machinery in canonical state.** stored enumeration lists,
  stand-in range-index records, and counter-driven pagination that exists
  only to serve a human surface are defects: the engine on this tier
  iterates natively, so that is where iteration lives. (a record dispatch
  itself needs — pages' folder-parent map for cycle checks, chat's bounded
  per-message emoji index for caps and tombstone cleanup — stays canonical:
  it serves a consensus decision, not a scan.)
- **everything a human lists, scrolls, or searches is a view here.** the
  UI's read surface is `/v1/index/{module}/view`, uniformly — chat pages
  and threads, the pages sidebar and comment panels, boards, feeds, search.
- **modules hold no state in RAM.** the in-memory snapshot-bytes cohort is
  a transitional shape scheduled for re-platforming onto qmdb + this tier
  (phase 2+, in dependency order: small registries first, the hot
  consensus-loop modules — valset, dispatch, saga, runs — last).

Exemptions are substrate facts, not preferences: forge's state *is* a git
repo (cloneable, greppable — an index would be a worse second copy), and
files' chunk bytes bypass consensus (no op stream to fold). A bounded
typed registry whose canonical reads are all dispatch-consumed (identity,
valset) simply has no read model to move.

The shipped mappers:

| module | read model | dispatch reads kept canonical |
| --- | --- | --- |
| chat | channel list, message pages, threads, revisions, reactions, members, `search` + `tags` | `Channel`, `MessagesRange` (agent context windows), `Message` (id probes) |
| pages | page list, per-target comment threads, `search` | `GetPage`/`GetBlock`, `CommentThread`/`GetComment`, `TargetThreadCount` (cap probe) |
| tasks | task `by_status` pages, job pages + census | task `List` (unpaged, dispatch-consumed), `JobsQuery::Get` |
| inbox | per-member notification pages, unread counts | none — nothing in consensus reads an inbox |
| saga | `usage` — the executor billing ledger | `Get`, `NextExpiry`, `AssignedPending` (all host/dispatch-required) |

## 6. Rebuild and failure story

There is ONE derivation path: the feed. When canonical state advances
WITHOUT the op stream — state-sync installs a boundary, an index directory
is wiped, recovery skips re-executing durable blocks — the module is stamped
BACKFILLED at the boundary (`mark_backfilled`): trigger torn down first
(discarding pending events — a wipe's deletes must never reach the guest as
feed traffic), watermark dropped, user keys cleared (the engine keyspace,
guest included, is invisible to the sweep and survives), watermark + floor
stamped, trigger re-registered. Its feed and views honestly BEGIN there,
visibly via `meta/backfill`; history below a boundary re-enters only by
replaying blocks through the feed or by the join-seam op-row backfill (§7).
The former from-state rebuild lane (mappers re-deriving rows from canonical
`Module::query` state) is deleted with the native mappers: one fold path,
no second derivation with its own degradation matrix.

- The index directory stays disposable: delete `<storage>/index` (or one
  module's subdirectory) and the tier heals — boundary stamps at the next
  boot, content accruing from new blocks behind a visible floor.
- noded resumes its local block counter **above** the index watermark so
  feed heights stay monotonic across restarts; at startup it stamps any
  module whose watermark trails the resume floor.
- The consensus validator feeds the identical contract from three sources:
  the live drain (every SEALED frame — a rejected frame feeds empty, it
  still consumed its height), the journal replay, and post-reboot frame
  catch-up; whatever they cannot reproduce converges on the boundary stamp.
- A standing RESIDENT feeds like a validator: the replica fold driver folds
  finalized frames (unified-node phase 2) and applies the per-block index
  fold from their dispatches. Boundary stamps fire only where state jumped
  WITHOUT frames — the join bootstrap and backfilled heights — and the
  blocks database gains one honest boundary row there
  (`IndexStore::apply_block_record`).
- **Host-write failures poison** (writes refuse, reads keep serving,
  remedy = rebuild). **Guest-fold failures never poison** — they hold that
  module's queue, observably (§3.2 rule 3). Two failure domains, two
  observables, one status route.
- Durability is `SyncMode::Periodic` (bounded loss window, torn tails
  truncate on recovery) — correct for a tier whose worst case is a rebuild.

## 7. State-sync: the join-seam op-row backfill

A joiner state-syncs **state**, not op history, so the feed has nothing to
carry — and a synced node whose views begin empty at the boundary renders its
modules as a workspace that lost its contents. The shipped answer is the
BACKFILL lane: the joiner fetches the SOURCE'S OWN op rows below its boundary
and writes them into its own feed.

The lane runs at the join seams (resident ascension, cold direct admission),
inline, BEFORE the node serves anything, over every module whose feed trails
the boundary:

1. a module that already holds a feed RESUMES: the walk starts strictly above
   its own watermark (`(watermark, u32::MAX)` — the watermark vouches for whole
   heights), so only the delta crosses the wire and the derived views folded
   from the rows below it stand untouched. `IndexStore::advance_watermark`
   closes it: the feed now reaches the boundary, and the floor never moved
   because nothing below it was ever dropped;
2. a module with nothing to resume from is STAMPED at the boundary (§6) —
   which re-registers a fresh fold trigger over an empty `op/` — and walks the
   whole history below it. So is one whose resume the source cannot cover
   (a source floor ABOVE the resume point would leave a hole between the two
   that a single floor cannot express);
3. either way `SyncRequest::IndexOps { boundary, module, after }` walks the
   source's rows in ASCENDING key order, cursor-paged and bounded by bytes,
   writing each page through `IndexStore::write_backfill_rows`;
4. the fold drains, and `IndexStore::set_backfill_floor` composes the source's
   own floor into a stamped module's — `None` when the source reaches genesis.

A module that is NOT stale can still be missing everything below its FLOOR, and
that gap is what a resident restarting over a wiped index directory holds: the
checkpoint heal stamps the empty databases and the journal replay folds the
suffix back on top, so every watermark is at the tip and nothing is stale.
The seam therefore also runs over the floored modules — the restart seam calls
the same helper the ascension does. The FEED is never wiped there: that module
has one, and a stamp would destroy it for a walk that can still fail on its
next page, leaving it worse than it was and doing the same again at the next
seam. The rows land UNDER the feed instead, which only ever GAINS rows here,
and the floor drops only when the walk completed.

The READ MODEL is a different matter: rows below what the fold already consumed
arrive out of key order by construction, so the derived keyspace is CLEARED and
re-driven from the whole feed afterwards (`IndexStore::refold` — drop the guest
marker, clear the derived keys, re-drive `op/` in key order, drain, write the
marker back), whether the walk finished or died holding half a range. Views are
blank for the length of that replay — the same window a mapper swap opens at
boot (§6) — with the feed under them intact throughout, and a walk that wrote
nothing skips it entirely. The marker discipline is what makes a crash mid-refold
safe: nothing vouches for the keyspace while it is being rebuilt, so an
interrupted refold is re-run whole by the next `open` instead of being adopted.

The walk is asked for only when it can succeed: one request from a cursor past
the boundary returns an empty page carrying the source's own floor, and a
source floored no lower than this node ends the matter there.

**Why no refold is needed, and why this window is the only one.** Pre-serving
there are no live folds, no ws subscribers, and no view readers on this node.
So ascending fetch-and-write makes COMMIT ORDER EQUAL KEY ORDER, which for
`op/{height:016x}/{seq:04x}` is block-and-drain order: the changes-mode trigger
folds every row correctly as it lands, and the fold tip advances monotonically
to the last backfilled row. Doing this later — against a folding, serving node
— would hand a guest history backwards, and is a defect rather than a slow path.
`write_backfill_rows` never touches `meta/height`: on a stamped module the heal
already set it, and it vouches for feed contiguity FROM THE FLOOR UP. A resumed
module's watermark moves once, after the walk (`advance_watermark`), for the
same reason — it may only claim the boundary once the rows below it have
landed.

Contents are NOT root-verifiable (the derived tier has no root by design), so
the lane trusts the serving node — accepted, because the read model is how a
node renders at all, and the joiner already trusted this exact node enough to
accept canonical state from it. What is still enforced, once, at the trust
boundary (`statesync::fetch_index_ops`): every key is byte-exactly the
canonical `op/{height:016x}/{seq:04x}` rendering of its own position,
`(height, seq)` ascends strictly across the whole walk, every height is at or
below the boundary, every row borsh-decodes as an `OpRow` agreeing with its own
key, the source's watermark covers the requested boundary (a source that folded
less would leave a HOLE above the joiner's floor), and the source's own floor
stays at or below that boundary (one that rose above it holds none of the range
being asked for).

The key check is byte equality, not a successful parse, and the difference is
load-bearing. `parse_op_key` reads hex with `from_str_radix`, which accepts any
width and a leading `+`: `op/2/0` parses to `(2, 0)` while sorting AFTER
`op/0000000000000009/0000`. Such a key would satisfy every other check above
and still break the one invariant this lane rests on — and the damage is
durable and silent, because the next `converge_guest` refold replays `op/` in
KEY order and would rebuild every derived view from history running backwards.
The FIXED WIDTH IS THE ORDERING, so it is verified as bytes. Any violation aborts
that module's backfill; its stamped floor stands, which is honest. Per-module
failure — network, validation, a source that re-stamped past the boundary —
never aborts the join: it warns once with a stable reason token and the rest of
the modules continue. A source that re-stamps MID-WALK, but still at or below
the boundary, is composed by taking the MAX floor seen across pages: the higher
floor is the one that does not overclaim.

The blocks database (`_blocks`) is deliberately NOT backfilled: its rows are
node-layer observations, not derived state, and a resident writes its own
honest boundary row instead (`IndexStore::apply_block_record`, §6).

## 8. The index-only node (direction)

The tier's shape is chosen so an index-only node is a module-generic
engine: block stream in (it must be able to READ applied dispatch traces
from the wire — the one open spec item), per-module databases with their
guests installed, generic feed writes, generic view/scan/ops routes out.
Zero per-module native code; mapper upgrades arrive as data (the module-code
registry distributes index guests exactly like consensus components). That
node is fluent31's serving surface plus this crate's feed — nothing else.
