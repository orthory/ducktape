# Capability Spec Reference (v1)

A **capability spec** is a TOML file that teaches a Ducktape node how to run
one executor — an installed CLI that can turn a prompt into text. Everything
the node needs is in the file: how to detect the binary, the exact argv to
invoke it, and how to parse its output. **Adding an executor is a config
change, never a code change** — the embedded built-ins are themselves spec
files globbed out of `crates/services/provider/specs/` at build time; no
Rust source names an executor.

Specs are the data half of the capability system:

| Layer | Owns | Code |
|---|---|---|
| Consensus (`crates/modules/system/capability`) | *who provides what*, network-wide: node key → announced tag set | never reads specs |
| Host (`crates/services/provider`) | *actually running it*: spec loading, binary discovery, spawning, parsing | this document |

The consensus registry only ever sees **tags**. The spec behind a tag is
private to each host — two nodes can announce the same tag with differently
tuned specs and the network cannot tell, by design.

---

## Dispatch: explicit capability, nothing inferred

A job names the capability tag it needs; `ProviderSet::resolve(tag)` maps the
tag to the locally discovered provider. That is the whole dispatch model:

- **Consensus says WHAT** — an agent record carries a `capability` tag, the
  saga trigger carries the same tag, and work is leased over the tag's
  announced providers.
- **The spec says HOW** — binary, flags, sandbox posture, and (if the
  executor takes one) the model, written literally into `[invoke].args`.
  Model choice is host policy; no model name ever crosses consensus.
- **Nothing is inferred.** There is no routing table, no pattern matching,
  no default fallback. A tag either has a loaded spec or resolution fails
  loudly naming the loaded set.

A finer-grained need — "this executor, but pinned to a specific model, with
different flags" — is a **finer tag with its own spec file**, not a routing
rule. Define `tag = "myllm-large"` with the pinning flags in its args, have
agents name that tag, and only hosts carrying that spec (and binary) announce
it. [`[[variants]]`](#variants--one-file-a-family-of-finer-tags) is load-time
sugar for writing a whole family of such finer tags in one file.

---

## Trust model — read this first

A spec names an arbitrary local binary and the argv to run it with. **Loading
a spec is executing code by proxy.** Specs are operator-trusted configuration,
in the same trust class as a shell profile or a systemd unit:

- They load from exactly two places, both local and operator-controlled:
  1. the specs **embedded in the node binary** at compile time
     (`crates/services/provider/specs/*.toml`);
  2. the **operator spec directory** (see [Spec sources](#spec-sources)).
- They are **never fetched from the network**, and no consensus code path can
  read one (host-local files are non-deterministic input).
- Argv is **fully literal** and passed to exec **without shell
  interpretation** — no placeholders, no quoting, no expansion. The prompt
  reaches the child only via stdin, so job content cannot inject flags or
  commands.
- The child process runs **fenced**: its working directory is the workspace
  the run's provisioner materialized (an empty scratch dir when the embedder
  provisions none, never the node's data dir itself), non-interactive mode,
  and whatever sandbox flags the spec's argv encodes. Fence flags live in the
  spec — audit them when you audit the spec.

**Auth: the credential never enters the child.** There is exactly one way:

- **`[isolation]`.** The *host* holds the credential and keeps it in the node
  process. A run-scoped, loopback-only broker serves the model API, and the
  child gets only an unrelated opaque run bearer, a localhost base URL, and a
  **fresh, empty config home** (which is what stops the CLI reading the
  operator's real one and forces it through the broker). Codex and Claude
  are both here.

**A spec cannot ask for a host directory instead.** A run executes inside its
own microVM, which shares no filesystem with the host — the only things that
cross are the per-run block devices the backend builds. There is no `[sandbox]`
table in the format, so a spec that declares one fails to load rather than being
accepted and quietly ignored. An executor that can only authenticate by reading
its own dotfiles cannot be lent by a node.

---

## Spec sources

Specs load in two passes:

1. **Embedded built-ins** — every `specs/*.toml` compiled into the node
   (globbed by `build.rs`, sorted by file name). These parse through the
   exact same code path as operator files and serve as the reference
   examples.
2. **Operator directory** — every `*.toml` in:
   - `$DUCKTAPE_CAPABILITY_DIR` if set. Pointing this at a missing directory
     is a **hard error** (you asked for a dir that isn't there);
   - otherwise `<ducktape home>/capabilities` (`$DUCKTAPE_HOME` when set,
     else `~/.ducktape`), only if it exists (absent default simply means "no
     operator specs").

**Override rule:** an operator spec whose `tag` matches a built-in **replaces
it wholesale** — there is no field-level merging; the spec file is the unit of
override. This is the supported way to retune a built-in (different sandbox
flags, a different timeout, an explicit model flag): copy the embedded spec,
edit, drop it in the directory.

**Duplicate rule:** two files in the operator directory claiming the same tag
is a **hard error** naming both files. Precedence between operator files would
be file-order guessing; the node refuses to guess.

**Failure posture:** a spec that fails to parse or validate is a **boot
error**, not a skipped file. An operator config mistake should stop the node
loudly, not silently drop an executor and let jobs fail later with a confusing
"capability not provided". If the binary is missing, though, the capability is
simply not announced — a spec sitting in the directory is inert, not an error.

## Full annotated example

```toml
# capability spec format version. this build understands exactly 1; any other
# value is rejected loudly so a future-format spec is never silently misread.
spec = 1

[capability]
# the tag announced to the network-wide capability registry. shape rules are
# EXACTLY the consensus module's: 1..=64 bytes of [a-z0-9._-]. a tag that
# validates here can never bounce off an on-chain Announce.
tag = "myllm"
# human-facing one-liner for docs and status surfaces. optional.
description = "example one-shot CLI executor"

[detect]
# the binary name probed on PATH (first executable match wins).
bin = "myllm"
# optional env var naming an EXPLICIT binary path. when set, it wins over the
# PATH probe — and if it points at something that is not an executable file,
# the capability is dropped with a loud warning. an explicit override never
# silently falls back to PATH: you said "use this", and this doesn't exist.
env = "MYLLM_BIN"

[invoke]
# argv, passed to exec() verbatim — never through a shell, no placeholders.
# encode your fence here: sandbox flags, non-interactive mode, turn limits —
# and, if the executor takes one, the model as an ordinary literal flag.
args = ["run", "--json", "--model", "large-v2"]
# how the prompt reaches the child. v1 supports only "stdin": the prompt is
# written to the child's stdin (concurrently with output collection, so huge
# prompts can't deadlock the pipe) and then EOF. an argv placeholder would
# leak prompts into `ps` output and hit ARG_MAX — deliberately unsupported.
prompt = "stdin"
# the child's IDLE budget in seconds (1..=3600, default 300): any output on
# either stream REFRESHES it, so a long agentic run that keeps streaming
# (codex --json events, tool chatter) is never killed mid-work — only a child
# SILENT this long dies. a quiet-by-design CLI (claude -p prints one result at
# the end) gets exactly this many seconds of silence, so budget for its
# longest silent stretch. a continuously-chatty child is still bounded at
# HARD_TIMEOUT_FACTOR (36) times this value (the host hard cap; the saga's
# consensus deadline bounds the run's outcome regardless).
# $DUCKTAPE_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT_SECS overrides every spec's idle budget at once
# (ops knob for slow hosts).
timeout_secs = 300

[output]
# which NAMED parser extracts the assistant's final text from stdout:
#   "jsonl-events" — a JSONL event stream; the LAST agent_message item wins;
#                    tolerates both item shapes seen in the wild and skips
#                    non-JSON noise lines.
#   "json-result"  — a single {"type":"result",...} object; an is_error
#                    result is surfaced as the error it is.
#   "text"         — raw stdout, trimmed. THE GENERIC ESCAPE HATCH: any CLI
#                    that prints the answer plainly works with zero code.
#                    empty output on a zero exit is an error ("ran fine,
#                    said nothing" is a broken executor, not an answer).
# this is a CLOSED set on purpose: each name is a tested parser for a real
# output contract. a new name is a code change with tests — that's the point.
format = "text"
```

A file like this dropped into the operator directory is the whole wiring of
a new executor: after a node restart, if the binary is executable on `PATH`,
discovery builds the provider, the node **announces** the tag to the
capability registry (network-wide, member-gated, idempotent), and an agent
registered with that `capability` dispatches here with exactly the argv
above. The provider crate's unit test
`an_operator_spec_discovers_a_custom_executor` exercises this path with a
fake CLI.

## Field reference

### Top level

| Field | Type | Required | Rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| `spec` | integer | yes | must be `1` |
| `[isolation]` | table | no | host-owned auth broker + fresh executor config home — see [Isolation](#isolation--host-owned-auth) |
| `[tools]` | table | no | argv injected into every argv the file produces — see [Tools](#tools--argv-injected-into-every-argv-the-file-produces) |
| `[[variants]]` | array of tables | no | load-time expansion into finer tags — see [Variants](#variants--one-file-a-family-of-finer-tags) |

Unknown fields **anywhere** in the file are rejected — a typo, or a section
this format does not have (`[sandbox]`, `[models]`, `[session]`,
`[workspace]`), fails loud instead of being silently ignored.

### `[capability]`

| Field | Type | Required | Rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tag` | string | yes | 1..=64 bytes, `[a-z0-9._-]` only — the shared consensus rule (`capability_interface::validate_tag`) |
| `description` | string | no | free text |

### `[detect]`

| Field | Type | Required | Rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bin` | string | yes | non-empty; probed on `PATH` |
| `env` | string | no | env var naming an explicit binary path; override wins, broken override = warn + absent |
| `companions` | string array | no (default `[]`) | required executable sibling file names; each is mounted beside `bin` in sandbox guests, and a missing one makes the capability absent |

### `[invoke]`

| Field | Type | Required | Rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| `args` | string array | no (default `[]`) | passed verbatim to exec; fully literal, no placeholders |
| `prompt` | string | yes | must be `"stdin"` in v1 |
| `timeout_secs` | integer | no (default `300`) | 1..=3600; IDLE budget — output refreshes it; killed after this much silence, or at `HARD_TIMEOUT_FACTOR` (36×) regardless |

### `[output]`

| Field | Type | Required | Rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| `format` | string | yes | `"jsonl-events"` \| `"json-result"` \| `"text"` |

### `[isolation]`

| Field | Type | Required | Rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| `config_home_env` | string | no | executor config-home env name such as `CODEX_HOME`; must match `[A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*` |
| `broker` | string | no | `"codex-responses"` \| `"anthropic-messages"`; credentials remain in the host process |

### `[tools]`

| Field | Type | Required | Rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| `args` | string array | yes (when the section is present) | spliced into every argv the file produces, immediately after `args[0]` |

### `[[variants]]`

| Field | Type | Required | Rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| `suffix` | string | yes | `<model>_<effort>`, each side `[a-z0-9.-]+` (so exactly one `_`) |
| `args` | string array | yes | the variant's **full** argv — verbatim, complete, never merged with or derived from the parent's args |

## Isolation — host-owned auth

An executor CLI needs a model credential. `[isolation]` is the one way to
arrange that (see [Trust model](#trust-model--read-this-first)):

```toml
[isolation]
config_home_env = "CODEX_HOME"
broker = "codex-responses"
```

The host holds the credential and keeps it in the node process. The child
gets:

- a **loopback base URL** spliced into its argv as a custom model provider, and
- an **opaque random bearer** minted for this run,

neither of which can recover the credential, and both of which die with the run.
`config_home_env` is what makes this real rather than decorative: the child's
`CODEX_HOME` is a **fresh, empty** directory under the run's reserved
`.ducktape-run/` tree, so the CLI *cannot* fall back to reading the operator's
`auth.json`. Empty is guaranteed by the NAME: the slot under `.ducktape-run/` is
drawn fresh per run, so no later run can name — and therefore inherit — an
earlier one's config home, and the directory is removed when the run that owns it
ends rather than left in a workdir the next run mounts. That reserved directory is
also deleted before DuckFS or Forge scans the workspace, so the provider's runtime
state can never enter a snapshot or commit.

The broker is deliberately not a generic proxy: it binds an ephemeral loopback
port, requires the per-run bearer, accepts only the one API shape its kind
names (Responses POSTs for `codex-responses`, Messages POSTs for
`anthropic-messages`), enforces body/response/total-byte, concurrency and
request-count budgets, and is torn down when the run ends. It substitutes the
host credential only on the upstream hop.

**How the guest reaches it.** A microVM has its own network stack, so the
broker's `127.0.0.1` is not the guest's. `duck-guest-init` closes that gap
without giving the guest any host network at all: it listens on the broker's
port on the VM's *own* loopback and tunnels each connection to the host over
vsock. The CLI dials the localhost URL its env names and never knows.

---

## Tools — argv injected into every argv the file produces

`[tools]` names the flags that wire a tool plane in — in the built-ins, the
Ducktape MCP server — without making every argv in the file repeat them:

```toml
[tools]
args = ["-c", 'mcp_servers.ducktape.command="ducktape-mcp"']
```

- **Insertion is immediately after `args[0]`, never at the end.** An argv
  like codex's ends in a bare `-` (the stdin marker) that must stay LAST;
  `args[0]` is always the mode/subcommand selector (`exec`, `-p`), so the
  slot after it is legal for every executor and stable across variants.
- It applies to the `[invoke] args` and to **every** `[[variants]]` `args`
  list (variants inherit `[tools]` like everything else — they never repeat
  it). No `[tools]` section, or an argv with fewer than one arg, means no
  insertion.
- Injection happens once, at load time: a spec in hand already has its
  tools, and one tag still means one fixed, fully literal argv.
- Override is still wholesale, by tag: an operator spec that replaces a
  built-in replaces its `[tools]` too. A `[tools]` section with no `args` is
  a hard error, like every other section that would do nothing.

The binary a `[tools]` argv names (`ducktape-mcp` in the built-ins) is resolved
from the **run's `PATH`** — the provisioner puts its directory there — so specs
name no absolute path and stay portable across hosts. Claude's built-in also
passes `--allowedTools mcp__ducktape`: in `-p` print mode there is no human to
approve a tool call, so an unapproved MCP call is a denial and a merely
*configured* server would be dead weight.

---

## Variants — one file, a family of finer tags

`[[variants]]` is **load-time sugar** over the finer-tag pattern above: each
entry registers an ADDITIONAL spec under the composed tag
`{parent_tag}_{suffix}`, exactly as if you had written one more spec file for
it. Nothing changes at dispatch time — **one tag still means one fixed,
fully literal argv**.

```toml
[capability]
tag = "myllm"
# … [detect] / [invoke] / [output] as above; the base tag's argv is untouched

# registers the tag "myllm_large-v2_high" with its OWN full argv.
[[variants]]
suffix = "large-v2_high"
args = ["run", "--model", "large-v2", "--effort", "high"]
```

A variant **inherits** `bin`, `env`, `prompt`, `timeout_secs`, `output`,
`[tools]` (and `description`) from the parent spec; `args` is its own, whole,
and literal. There is no field merging and no placeholder substitution — the
"argv is literal" invariant holds per tag, and there is no routing table, no
pattern matching, and no substitution anywhere in the invoke path.

**The tag grammar.** A composed tag is `{provider}_{model}_{effort}` and
splits into **exactly three segments on `_`** — the contract the desktop
app's provider/model/effort picker decomposes tags by (e.g.
`codex_gpt-5.5_xhigh`, `claude_opus_max`). The loader enforces it fail-loud:
the parent tag must be underscore-free (a `my_llm` parent cannot declare
variants — write separate spec files instead); the suffix must be
`<model>_<effort>` with both sides non-empty `[a-z0-9.-]+`; the composed tag
must pass the shared consensus tag rule (≤ 64 bytes); duplicate suffixes in
one file — and composed tags colliding with any other tag in the operator
dir — are hard errors; unknown fields inside an entry are rejected. A tag
that does not follow the grammar is still a perfectly good tag — the app just
treats it as opaque (selectable as-is, no cascading picker).

**Override semantics are unchanged**: a variant tag is its own tag, and
operator specs override **by tag, wholesale**. Overriding a built-in base tag
(say `codex`) does NOT touch its built-in variant tags (`codex_*_*` remain);
override those individually if you want them retuned, or shadow them with an
operator file declaring its own `[[variants]]`.

The embedded built-ins use this to ship a curated model/effort matrix:
`codex` (base) plus
`codex_{gpt-5.6-sol,gpt-5.6-terra,gpt-5.6-luna}_{low,medium,high,xhigh,max}`
and `codex_gpt-5.5_{low,medium,high,xhigh}` (the effort set follows what each
model actually supports, so the codex side is not a rectangle), and `claude`
(base) plus `claude_{fable,opus,sonnet,haiku}_{low,medium,high,max}`.

---

## Environment knobs

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `DUCKTAPE_CAPABILITY_DIR` | operator spec directory (explicit; missing dir = boot error) |
| *(per spec)* `[detect].env` | each spec may name its own explicit-binary override var — see the embedded specs for theirs |
| `DUCKTAPE_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT_SECS` | overrides **every** spec's `timeout_secs` at once |

---

## Versioning

`spec = 1` is the only version this build reads, and there are no live
networks, so the format changes in place: a section this build does not know
fails loudly at boot as an unknown field, never as a silent behavior change.
Every run starts cold — a run's whole continuity is its envelope, which is
what lets any assignee execute it — and a run's cwd is the workspace its
provisioner materialized, so the format has no per-run session or workspace
sections. Yes, that is strict; strict is the point: a spec means one thing,
on every build that accepts it.
