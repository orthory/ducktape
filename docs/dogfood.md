# Dogfood ceremony: ducktape develops ducktape

The operator's runbook for the agent dogfooding loop: host this repo in its
own forge, provision a model user over it, open an issue that references a Pages
spec, mention the agent, and review the resulting PR and block-anchored spec
commentary in the app, with run outcomes available through the query API.

## 0. Prereqs

- **A running node.** The dev app (`make dev`) runs a single-node workspace
  where your node is the validator — the simplest setup, everything below
  targets it. A multi-node network works too; where it matters ("validator"
  vs "resident") the steps say so. By default every TCP listener binds
  `127.0.0.1`; `DEV_LISTEN=0.0.0.0 DEV_ADVERTISED=<this box's LAN ip>`
  widens the p2p mesh and HTTP API binds AND the dial hint peers actually
  use, so a second machine can join, huddle in, or point its app at this
  node (the WireGuard plane is bound wide regardless).
- **Host `git` on `PATH`, with worktree support.** The provisioner probes
  once at construction (`git init` + `git worktree list` in a scratch dir,
  `crates/noded/src/agent_provision/forge.rs`); a failed probe makes the forge
  lane permanently unavailable, loudly. Forge repos are git-default **sha1**
  — do NOT set `init.defaultObjectFormat = sha256` host-wide; a sha256 clone
  cannot interop with the node's repos.
- **An enabled compute service with a working microVM sandbox.** Install
  guest-architecture executors into the workspace with `ducktape agent
  install claude -n <chain-id>` or `ducktape agent install codex -n
  <chain-id>`, including the spec's declared companions. Discovery checks the
  workspace's executor directory (`<workspace>/executors`). Custom specs live
  under `<workspace>/capabilities/` (`docs/records/specs/capability-spec.md`).
  `make demo-seed` registers the demo's ChiefDuck on the built-in `claude`
  spec with the full action vocabulary, forge read and push on the seeded
  `playground` repo and on `ducktape`, every page, and its persona
  (`ops/chiefduck/SKILL.md`) as an always-loaded skill; `make dev` then
  installs the claude CLI into the workspace so its runs execute.
- **Provider authentication on the executing service.** Codex uses
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `CODEX_HOME/auth.json`; Claude uses `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
  `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, or `~/.claude/.credentials.json`. Installing an
  executable does not configure its credentials.
- **Raise the provider timeout for cold Rust builds.**
  `DUCKTAPE_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT_SECS=<secs>` on the executing compute service
  overrides the spec's *idle* timeout. The hard wall-clock cap is
  **idle × `[invoke].hard_timeout_factor`** (default 36)
  and the child is killed at the cap even while producing output, so budget
  for a first `cargo build` in a fresh worktree.

## 1. Push the repo: `make dogfood-forge`

```sh
make dogfood-forge
```

`ops/dogfood-forge.sh` resolves the node's HTTP base
from `DUCKTAPE_DEV_FORGE_URL` or, with exactly one workspace under the
ducktape home, that workspace's `http_listen` in its `node.toml`, failing if
neither resolves (the home is `$DUCKTAPE_HOME` when set, else `~/.ducktape`),
registers a normal git remote `ducktape-dev` at `<base>/forge/ducktape`,
fetches `origin/dev`, and reconciles it with the forge's `refs/heads/dev`.
It fast-forwards when possible, retains a Forge descendant, or joins equal-tree
divergence with a two-parent bridge; differing-tree divergence fails. It reads
the Forge ref back and verifies the selected tip. Repo creation is the first push — no separate
create step. The whole packfile travels over git smart-HTTP and is stored
node-locally; only a tiny `forge Push` (digest + oids) crosses consensus. Run
this before creating or invoking agent work so a clean but stale local
checkout cannot silently pin the run to obsolete source.

Knobs: `FORGE_REPO` (default `ducktape`), `FORGE_REMOTE` (default
`ducktape-dev`), `SOURCE_REMOTE` (default `origin`), `SOURCE_BRANCH` (default
`dev`), `SRC_REF` (explicit local-ref override), `DUCKTAPE_DEV_FORGE_URL`.

Verify: the `ducktape` repo appears in the desktop **Forge** view with `dev`
browsable. Re-run `make dogfood-forge` before later agent work; a raw
`git push ducktape-dev dev` bypasses the fetch and reconciliation checks. Caveat: the
remote lives in the shared `.git/config`, visible to every worktree of this
repo — set `FORGE_REMOTE` per worktree if you run several nodes at once.

**A push must prove itself.** `git-receive-pack` takes exactly two proofs:
git's own push certificate (`git push --signed`, whose signer becomes the
repo's owner on chain), or the node's operator credential, which makes the
NODE the owner. `make dogfood-forge` presents the second — it is seeding the
node's own mirror — and a bare `git push` at a node whose `admin.token` you
cannot read is refused. To push by hand:

```sh
export GIT_CONFIG_COUNT=1 GIT_CONFIG_KEY_0=http.extraHeader
export GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_0="x-ducktape-admin-token: $(cat <workspace>/admin.token)"
git push ducktape-dev dev
```

`GIT_CONFIG_*` rather than `git -c`: an argv is world-readable through
`/proc`, and this is a secret.

## 2. Provision the dogfood model user

The persona is an **always skill**: a SKILL.md under
/shared/skills/<name>/ whose body the host includes in the run context.
The model user is a keyless identity account running a program; runs stores
its provider, action grants, resource caps and skill references.

The commands below use curl, jq, Python 3 and the current ducktape binary.
They act through the node's operator credential, so that node's identity
account controls the new model user. Use that same controller for later
configuration changes; an app wallet is a separate principal.

```sh
BASE="<base>"
WORKSPACE="<workspace>"
OPERATOR="$(cat "$WORKSPACE/admin.token")"

submit() {
  jq -nc --arg target "$1" --argjson payload "$2" '{target:$target,payload:$payload}' |
    curl -fsS "$BASE/v1/submit" -H 'content-type: application/json' \
      -H "x-ducktape-admin-token: $OPERATOR" --data-binary @-
}
query() {
  jq -nc --arg target "$1" --argjson query "$2" '{target:$target,query:$query}' |
    curl -fsS "$BASE/v1/query" -H 'content-type: application/json' --data-binary @-
}

# Resolve the actual submitting key, founding its controller account if absent.
NODE_KEY="$(ducktape node key --out "$WORKSPACE/identity.key" | tail -n 1)"
KEY_BYTES="$(python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.dumps(list(bytes.fromhex(sys.argv[1]))))' "$NODE_KEY")"
CONTROLLER="$(query identity "{\"of_key\":{\"key\":$KEY_BYTES}}" | jq -r '.account.number // empty')"
if [ -z "$CONTROLLER" ]; then
  submit identity '{"create":{"name":"Dogfood operator","scheme":"ed25519"}}'
  CONTROLLER="$(query identity "{\"of_key\":{\"key\":$KEY_BYTES}}" | jq -er '.account.number')"
fi

curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE/v1/files/object/shared/skills/dogfood/SKILL.md" \
  -H "x-ducktape-admin-token: $OPERATOR" \
  --data-binary 'You are the dogfooding duck. Work the referenced spec.'

# Serialize the current default script; do not maintain a separate recipe copy.
PROGRAM="$(ducktape agent model-program dogfood)"
submit agent "$(jq -nc --argjson program "$PROGRAM" \
  '{provision:{name:"Dogfood Duck",program:$program}}')"
MODEL_ACCOUNT="$(query identity "{\"controlled\":{\"by\":$CONTROLLER,\"from\":0,\"limit\":256}}" |
  jq -er '.accounts | map(select(.name == "Dogfood Duck" and .control.program.executor == "agent")) |
    if length == 1 then .[0].number else error("choose a unique dogfood program account") end')"

submit runs "$(jq -nc --argjson account "$MODEL_ACCOUNT" '{
  configure_model:{operation:{register_model:{
    account:$account, agent_id:"dogfood", display_name:"Dogfood Duck",
    capability:"<your provider tag>",
    allowed_actions:["*"],
    caps:{forge_read:["ducktape"],forge_push:["ducktape"],pages_write:["*"],
          duckfs_read:["/shared/skills"]},
    skills:[{name:"dogfood",source_prefix:"/shared/skills/dogfood",load:"always"}]
  }}}
}')"

query runs '{"model":{"query":{"agent":{"agent_id":"dogfood"}}}}'
```

The final reply is model.agent; its account must equal MODEL_ACCOUNT.
IdentityQuery::Controlled is paged; use its from cursor when the controller
already owns more than 256 accounts. Names are display labels, so the
selection above fails if the controller has several Dogfood Duck accounts.

ConfigureModel wraps runs::ModelMsg from
crates/modules/apps/runs/src/model.rs. The current program account or its
live identity controller can update the record. allowed_actions names exact
catalog actions (runs::KNOWN_ACTIONS), with "*" granting every action the
catalog knows now or later. Forge caps name exact repos and pages_write exact
page ids, each with "*" permitting all of them at the runs validation layer.
Source modules still enforce their own ownership.
A skill without source_snapshot follows the committed library head; supply
a snapshot id to pin it. The app's Agents view lists the resulting model,
its grants and its controller.

## 3. Write the spec in Pages

Create a page in the **Pages** view. Use **to-do blocks** for the task items
— `pages.set_checked` only applies to todo-kind blocks, so a checklist gives
you a checklist to tick as the model reports completed work.

Note the **page id**: the app mints a UUID per page (the root block id). It
isn't shown in the editor chrome; recover it from the pages view (the index
tier, `docs/records/specs/indexable-spec.md`):

```sh
curl -s <base>/v1/index/pages/view -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"list_pages":{"limit":50}}'
# → ids + titles, cursor-paged; pick your spec's id.
```

## 4. Open the issue with a page link

Forge view → the `ducktape` repo → **Issues** → *New issue*. Put
`[spec](duck://page/<your-page-id>)` in the body.

At run compose, every ref found in the trigger message or the injected issue
body resolves against committed pages state and the page's whole subtree is
rendered into the run's context: headings, `- [ ]`/`- [x]` todos with an
inline `[blk:<id>]` on todo blocks (the ids the agent targets with its pages
actions), fenced code, a 64 KiB budget with a truncation marker
(`PAGE_CONTEXT_BYTES`, `crates/modules/apps/runs/src/inject.rs`). Page and
attachment resolution share the dispatch's bounded reference-read budget. An
unresolvable ref becomes a one-line "not found" marker — never a failed run.
One limit: refs sitting past the 16 KiB item-body truncation point
(`MAX_CONTEXT_BYTES`) aren't seen.

## 5. Mention the agent — and iterate in the PR

In the issue's **Discussion** tab, `@`-mention the agent (the composer's
typeahead resolves its account). The message commits, attribution delivers
the mention, and its program calls runs to start model work. The run then:

1. provisions an isolated clone with detached HEAD at the pinned base commit,
   with its skills mounted read-only beside it,
2. works, commits, and pushes `agent/item-<issue-number>`,
3. proposes a PR and a reply through program calls. The PR title prefers the
   bound issue's title, using the reply's first line as a fallback. The output
   tip, source branch and open item must still match when the action applies.

Repeating the mention in the original issue's Discussion continues
`agent/item-<issue-number>` and updates its existing PR.

A mention in PR `<n>`'s Discussion (hidden channel `forge:ducktape:<n>`)
forks that PR's source branch into `agent/item-<n>` and opens a child PR
targeting the original source branch. Repeated mentions in that same
Discussion continue `agent/item-<n>` and reuse the child PR. The original
source branch advances when the proposed changes are merged.

While it works, the agent can `pages.comment` on spec blocks (comments land
authored by its program account on the page). Whoever ticks a spec todo, human or
program, is recorded on it. Preflight skips emit debug breadcrumbs under
`ducktape::modules`; enable that log target to inspect them. Once an action
is admitted, its program call has an independent target outcome in
`ActionRequest`; a refusal cannot undo earlier successful effects. If a comment
didn't land, inspect that receipt, the model's `pages_write` capability and the
target block/page id. Replies and other proposed effects also depend on their
own call outcomes.

## 6. Review in-app

- **Forge view**: the PR (files/diff, merge box), the `agent/item-<n>`
  branch, and the discussion trail.
- **The spec page**: agent-authored comment threads anchored to the blocks
  they discuss; todos ticked as the work lands.

Inspect the last 100 terminal runs with the query helper from provisioning:

```sh
query runs '"recent_runs"'
```

History records include the executing node, output reference and verified PR
number. Their creation/delivery counters measure blocks, not wall-clock time.

`result_accepted` means the model result passed validation; the program decides
which proposed actions to execute. A reported program or target refusal marks
the run `action_rejected`, and its `ActionRequest` query retains the reason.
`failed` records worker failure, cancellation, or invalid output. PR links name
only an existing verified PR or a successfully committed allocation.

## Known limits

- **No page read-authorization:** `[spec](duck://page/<id>)` injection renders any
  referenced page's subtree into the run context with no read-cap gate
  (pages are workspace-visible to members). A member can surface any page
  they can already see.
- **Page depth is bounded:** one document allows 64 parent edges
  (`MAX_PAGE_DEPTH`). A nested Page block is a leaf in its containing
  document and starts a separate 64-edge document.
- **Concurrent branch advance is absorbed, not lost**: on a push reject the
  provisioner fetches, rebases and re-pushes a bounded number of times
  (`rebased: true` in the receipt). Rebase conflicts, exhausted push retries
  and other commit failures can degrade the run.
- A losing re-leased attempt's push can leave branch residue in a narrow
  race — harmless, but you may see an unexpected commit on the work branch.
- **Usage starts at the indexer's deploy boundary**: the ledger doesn't
  rebuild history, so runs before the indexer first ran are absent. "All
  time" means "since this deploy".

## Deploy a component from a chat run

The node process runs the module deployment executor alongside its API. There
is no separate executor binary. A model with `modules.update` in
`allowed_actions` can ask its program to deploy an existing module from the
run's committed forge output. The runs Wasm projects each validator's next
directive from committed state.
The native bridge stages a hash-pinned forge file or submits the directive's
opaque message with its own node key. Module loadability is checked by the
registry's readiness process before activation. This is automatic under
validator-ballot governance; a network using governance shares receives a rejected deployment because node keys cannot cast account ballots.

Register the target module first, for example:

```sh
ducktape module register hello crates/kernel/host/tests/fixtures/hello.component.wasm \
  --after 50 --config "$WORKSPACE/node.toml"
```

Commit an artifact containing the replacement component to the run's repository.
The guest can build it offline when its image contains the compiler and the
repository vendors its dependencies. Its network is limited to host tunnels for
granted services. The executor consumes committed artifacts; source compilation
belongs to the run's build tools. The existing replacement fixture is
`crates/kernel/host/tests/fixtures/hello-replacement.component.wasm`.

The model's final JSON response can include:

```json
{
  "reply_blocks": [{"kind":"paragraph","text":"Replacement committed; deployment requested."}],
  "commit_message": "Update hello to count by one hundred",
  "actions": [{"operation": "modules.update", "input": {
    "module_id": "hello",
    "artifact": "hello.module",
    "code_hash": "<canonical artifact SHA-256 in lowercase hex>",
    "after": 50
  }}]
}
```

`artifact` is a preassembled deployment file within the output commit. The host
binds the repository, output branch and exact commit before passing the action
to the program. The hash covers the canonical `ModuleArtifact`, including its
length prefixes and optional mapper, rather than the component file alone:

```sh
ducktape module pack hello.component.wasm --out hello.module
```

Pass `--index <mapper.wasm>` to include a mapper. An artifact without a
mapper removes the target's existing mapper when it activates. Activation is
at the governance execute height plus `after`, with readiness required from every
validator.

The run's program reply acknowledges the request. Observe actual deployment
through the durable queue, using the `query` function above:

```sh
query runs '{"next_module_update":null}'
query runs '{"module_update":{"sequence":0}}'
```

A record contains the requesting program account, run, pinned forge source,
artifact spec and `requested`, `activated` or `rejected` status. Completed
records remain queryable across restarts. An expired swap or rejected proposal
releases the queue for the next request; it does not automatically create a new
proposal. Read the rejected reason before requesting another deployment.

The `node-work` crate defines the bridge protocol. It accepts opaque submissions
and preassembled forge blobs, with source-selected success and invalid-blob
continuations. Deployment voting rules, sequencing and completion conditions
live in the runs Wasm. A module policy change uses the normal Wasm update path;
the native bridge has no governance action or deployment state to change.

A directive can repeat after a restart or concurrent transaction. The source
must derive it from committed state and choose idempotent messages. The
deployment controller records per-validator staging receipts and uses stable
proposal ids, committed votes and registry status; the bridge keeps no private
workflow checkpoint. Clock values in its query are hints from local committed
status. Every target still validates messages against its execution context.

The standard Linux guest includes the Rust toolchain from `rust-toolchain.toml`,
the wasm32 target, native build utilities and the `wasm-tools` CLI of the
componentizer's release (the `wit-component` pin in
`bin/guest-builder/Cargo.toml`). Build it at the default location with:

```sh
ops/build-guest-rootfs.sh
```

Linux setup requires Bubblewrap with user namespaces, in addition to the base
image builder's tools. It runs inside the extracted guest root with private,
disk-backed scratch and receives no host home, credentials or caches.
`ROOTFS_SETUP=/path/to/setup.sh` replaces the setup and receives command-line
arguments; `ROOTFS_SETUP=` builds only the base image. macOS builds the base
image without this Linux setup hook. Repositories must vendor dependencies for
offline builds: the run's VM can reach only its host service tunnels.

Writable run filesystems provide 8 GiB of sparse capacity. Only written blocks
consume host disk. The read-only input image retains its measured size plus
metadata margin. Headless Claude invocations allow shell, file and Ducktape MCP
tools without interactive approval; the VM and committed grants define access.

The live repair test uses the standard Claude capability, an installed CLI and
the host broker credential. The e2e lanes stage a node's workspace themselves:
`DUCKTAPE_GUEST_DIR` names the guest build they link in as each node's
`guest/`, and `DUCKTAPE_EXECUTOR_DIR` the installed CLIs the live lane execs
(a workspace's `executors/` after `ducktape agent install`). Keep `TMPDIR`
short and disk-backed for Unix sockets.
The live test is opt-in because it spends provider budget:

```sh
cargo test -p node-bin --test chat_module_upgrade_e2e \
  a_blind_agent_repairs_and_deploys_from_symptoms \
  -- --ignored --nocapture
```

The agent receives an incident report describing the observed count after a
click, faulty counter source, its wire interface and vendored dependencies.
The source comes from `hello-wasm` with unrelated conformance operations and
fixture labels removed. No repair recipe, build script, expected patch, clean
history or repaired artifact enters its checkout. Standard MCP instructions
explain the available build tools and deployment API to every run.

The host harness provisions a single-validator network and a model with
`chat.post` and `modules.update`, registers the faulty module, opens the issue
and posts the mention. The test node advertises two cores and 4 GiB of memory.
After activation the host independently rebuilds the delivered source, checks
preserved state and corrected increments, restarts the node and checks again.
Those recovery checks are host assertions; the agent's run ends with its
deployment request. This tests blind repair of one arithmetic fault, rather
than general autonomous incident detection or agent verification after deployment.
Evidence is retained under `target/self-heal/evidence/`; the provider trace is
written as events arrive and is owner-readable only. Canary and path assertions
check those specific leaks; they do not establish what the model inferred.
