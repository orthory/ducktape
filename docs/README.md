# Documentation index

One line per document, grouped by the question it answers, so an agent or an
operator loads the one file that answers it instead of the tree. The rule for
what lives here is `AGENTS.md` § "Docs Are Not a Record": `docs/` holds what
an operator executes and the few references code or a skill cites by path.
Nothing here is a plan, a status page, or a decision record, and a document
nothing cites is deleted, not archived.

## Start here

| Question | Read |
| --- | --- |
| What is this, how is the tree laid out, how do I build, test and run it | [`../README.md`](../README.md) |
| What rules bind an assistant working in this repo | [`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) |

## Operate a node

| Question | Read |
| --- | --- |
| Keep a node and its service daemons up under systemd (Linux) or launchd (macOS); ports; logs; why three validators tolerate nothing | [`deploy/node-service.md`](deploy/node-service.md) |
| Which files are secrets, which are irreplaceable, what to copy, what a restore looks like | [`deploy/backup-and-keys.md`](deploy/backup-and-keys.md) |
| Run the untrusted coordinator (rendezvous + first-contact relay); stand up two NAT'd validators | [`deploy/coordinator.md`](deploy/coordinator.md) |
| Front a validator with a sentry so it exposes no inbound port | [`deploy/sentry-deployment.md`](deploy/sentry-deployment.md) |
| Run the dogfooding loop: this repo in its own forge, an agent working it | [`dogfood.md`](dogfood.md) |
| Bring the microVM sandbox up on macOS (the vz shim) | [`sandbox-macos.md`](sandbox-macos.md) |
| Which operator scripts, units and harnesses live under `ops/` | [`../ops/README.md`](../ops/README.md) |
| The coordinator's deploy artifacts (unit, env file, Dockerfile) | [`../ops/coordinator/README.md`](../ops/coordinator/README.md) |
| The hosted WebAuthn auth page, its request/result shapes and its relay | [`../ops/auth-page/README.md`](../ops/auth-page/README.md) |
| Run the desktop app; which node it dials and which key it signs with | [`../app/README.md`](../app/README.md) |
| Lend a credential to a sandbox through airlock, self-hosted or from an enclave | [`../crates/airlock/README.md`](../crates/airlock/README.md) |

## References code cites by path

| Question | Read | Cited by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The capability spec TOML that describes an executor | [`records/specs/capability-spec.md`](records/specs/capability-spec.md) | `crates/services/provider` |
| The per-module index guest contract: fold rules, view rules, backfill | [`records/specs/indexable-spec.md`](records/specs/indexable-spec.md) | `crates/kernel/indexer`, the module-dev skill |
| The WireGuard tunnel upgrade protocol: records, mesh version, handshake, overlay addressing | [`records/protocols/wireguard-tunnel-upgrade.md`](records/protocols/wireguard-tunnel-upgrade.md) | `crates/networking/wireguard` |
| The reachability plane: control mesh beside data tunnel, the tunnel-first invite and its fronts, cold restart, rendezvous | [`records/architecture/reachability.md`](records/architecture/reachability.md) | `crates/networking/reachability` |
| The ordering contract agents get and the module architecture that keeps it | [`records/architecture/agent-collaboration-design.md`](records/architecture/agent-collaboration-design.md) | `runs`, `saga` |
| Writing, building and live-updating a wasm module | [`records/architecture/wasm-module-authoring.md`](records/architecture/wasm-module-authoring.md) | the module-dev skill |

## Agent runbooks (`skills/`)

| When | Skill |
| --- | --- |
| Verifying a running node, a cluster, the app, or a huddle | [`../skills/qa/SKILL.md`](../skills/qa/SKILL.md) |
| A Rust test needs a deterministic in-process node | [`../skills/sim-lane/SKILL.md`](../skills/sim-lane/SKILL.md) |
| Creating, porting, or registering a consensus module | [`../skills/module-dev/SKILL.md`](../skills/module-dev/SKILL.md) |

## Vendored patches

Each directory under `patches/` carries a note stating what the patch changes
and when it can be dropped: `PATCH.md` for `block` and `blst` (their
`README.md` is the upstream crate's own), `README.md` for `cosmic-text`.

`docs/superpowers/` is gitignored planning scratch; nothing under it ships.
