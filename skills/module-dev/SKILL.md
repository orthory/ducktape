description: Use when creating a new ducktape consensus module, porting a native module to a wasm guest, or wiring a module into the genesis set — topology::PRODUCTION, host_state, crates/guests, Makefile wasm-modules. Also when a module change breaks the root-hash pin, the registry parity test, a missing component in the fixtures/modules dir, or wasm-modules-check.

# Module development — the end-to-end wiring runbook

A module is four layers: native crate (the logic) → wasm guest (the packaging)
→ registration (the topology, then THREE bins) → proofs (parity + fixtures).

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** `docs/records/architecture/wasm-module-authoring.md`
— the guest contract (host-owned state, sibling reads, live update, the
cutover pattern). This skill is the wiring checklist that record doesn't cover.
A module written outside this tree needs none of it: see "Decide first".

## Decide first: genesis registration is a root-hash break

A module in `topology::PRODUCTION` (the selection `bin/node` composes,
opens its index over, and reports) joins the genesis set: every existing
workspace fails closed, dev networks re-genesis, and `GENESIS_ROOT_HASH`
moves. A genesis module ⇒ a new genesis — get that agreed before wiring.

A POST-genesis module does NOT move the root and needs no genesis edit, no
topology row, and no bin change — it is one operator command against a LIVE
network:

```
ducktape module register <id> <component.wasm> [--after N]  # admit a new id
ducktape module update   <id> <component.wasm> [--after N]  # swap live code
ducktape module status                                      # the registry
```

`register`/`update` stage the component at this node's owner-gated admin route
(which fans it out to every validator and returns their receipts), then drive
the governance proposal that schedules the admission/swap; it activates at
`height + N` (`N > MIN_SWAP_LEAD`, i.e. `> 3`; default 50 to leave room for the
ceremony's own blocks). `status` prints one row per module — `id  active
pending`, a pending swap carrying `ready k` (validators that signalled) or
`ready ✓`. Restore and state sync compose the wasm set from the registry's
roster at the boundary (`noded::compose`, `Boot::Reopen`), so an admitted id
composes like a genesis one; a module admitted after the last checkpoint
starts fresh and is rebuilt by replay (`seat_at`, unit-pinned in
`host_state.rs`).

The CLI stages bytes, it never builds them: the component still comes from
`make wasm-modules` / `guest-builder` (§2). A module written outside this
tree needs none of that: it is a cdylib crate pinning `ducktape-module-sdk`
(`crates/module-sdk`) by git revision, built with `cargo build --target
wasm32-unknown-unknown --release` and `wasm-tools component new`, then handed
to `module register` — the manifest and recipe are in
`docs/records/architecture/wasm-module-authoring.md` ("Out-of-tree modules").
Experiments that shouldn't pay the genesis cost live unwired in `crates/labs`.

## 1. Native crate — `crates/modules/{apps|system}/<id>`

Clone the `tasks` shape:
- `src/interface.rs` — wire types + codecs at crate root. The ONLY surface
  other modules may import.
- `src/lib.rs` — the struct + `impl sdk::Module` (`root`, `execute`, `query`,
  `commit_block`) + `snapshot()`/`install()`. Re-export `interface` at root.
- `tests/` — happy path, every rejection, snapshot→install root round-trip.
- Root `Cargo.toml`: `members` entry + `[workspace.dependencies]` alias.
- Native-only deps (media engines, unix IO, tokio) must sit behind a `native`
  feature or be absent — the guest builds compile this same crate to wasm32.

## 2. Wasm guest — `src/guest.rs` in the module crate, built by guest-builder

The module carries its OWN port (the `tasks`/`chat`/`files` shape): a
`src/guest.rs` behind a wasm-only `guest = ["dep:ducktape-module-sdk"]`
feature — the doc header, the id consts, and ONE dispatch-shell macro
(`ducktape_module_sdk::snapshot_guest!` for whole-state `SnapshotBytes`
modules, `store_guest!` for store-backed ones, or a hand-written `Guest` impl
+ `export_module!` for odd tenants like files). Each macro takes the
component's `shape:` — the host learns everything it needs to run the
module from the `shape` export, never from a table: `store_shape()` /
`map_shape()` / `odb_shape()`, with `config: vec![CHAIN_ID.into()]` (or
`INVITE`) on top for a network-bound module and `committed_queries: true`
for a committed-only query lane. `#[cfg(feature = "guest")] mod guest;` in
lib.rs. No packaging crate is checked in: `bin/guest-builder` builds the
module ALONE, out of the platform repository at the checkout's HEAD (so
push first — uncommitted module, SDK, sibling, and workspace build inputs
are refused, and an unpushed HEAD fails to fetch), through an ephemeral shell workspace under
`target/guest-builder/<id>/`, and writes the canonical COMMITTED
`component.wasm` and `guest.lock` (the revision and every registry version
the artifact came from; the seed of the next build) into the module
directory. Bytes move only when something the module compiles moves.

`Makefile`: add the module to `BUILDER_MODULES` — that one entry covers the
build, the fixture `cp`, and the `wasm-modules-check` / `wasm-rebuild-check`
`cmp`s.

## 2b. Index guest (optional) — the module's derived-tier mapper

A module that wants a materialized view (search, listings — anything qmdb's
point lookups can't serve) ships a SECOND wasm artifact: the index guest
(spec: `docs/records/specs/indexable-spec.md`). Same two-file shape in the
module crate:
- `src/index.rs` — the pure decision core: `fold_op`/`serve_view` over the
  `index_guest` contract crate (dep `index_guest = { workspace = true }`,
  never `indexer`). Unit-test natively against a `BTreeMap`.
- `src/index_guest.rs` behind `index-guest = ["index_guest/guest"]` — the
  ~15-line engine shell (`EngineRead`, `apply`, `index_guest::fold!`/`view!`).

`guest-builder --index <module-dir>` writes the committed `index.wasm`; add
the module to `INDEX_MODULES` in the Makefile. The `src/index_guest.rs`
file IS the declaration: noded's build script stages `<id>.index.wasm` into
the founding set for exactly the module crates that carry it, and `node
init` composes the genesis from whatever `<id>.index.wasm` the set holds.
The fold runs ASYNC behind a fluent31 changes-mode trigger — views trail
the op feed observably (`/v1/index/status` `fold.{module}`), never
atomically.

The engine's side of that contract — no backfill at registration, at-least-once
invocation with exactly-once effects, a row above the inline cap arriving
key-only, a failing fold holding its queue with backoff — is fluent31's own
`SKILL.md` ("Priors that do not transfer"), at the rev the root `Cargo.toml`
pins; read it before writing a mapper. A guest's `log` output is a `debug`
event under `fluent31::wasm::guest` — turn that one target up to see it.

## 3. Registration — `module register`, or (for genesis) the topology

Post-genesis is the whole of this section for most modules: `ducktape module
register <id> <component.wasm>` admits the id on a live network and `ducktape
module update <id> <component.wasm>` swaps its code later. The registry is
consensus state, so nothing below needs editing — every node composes the
admitted module from it.

`module update` swaps the CODE, never the DATA: `WasmModule::swap_code`
replaces the component and leaves the store untouched. The new component must
therefore be schema-IDENTICAL to the old one — same key derivation, same value
encodings — not merely schema-compatible. A store-backed module's logical keys
are hashed before they touch the store (`staged_store::store_key`, `sha256`),
so the store carries no order and no prefix a new component could scan; the
`ducktape:module` WIT world exports three functions — `shape` (a pure
constant of the code: the backing and committed-query mode `swap_code` reads
to decide whether the replacement may keep the store), `execute`, and
`query` — and there is no migrate/scan import: a new component cannot
enumerate the records a key- or value-shape
change would need to rewrite, because the keyspace it would scan is exactly
the sha256 digests it can't invert. A key-layout or value-shape change is a
new module id — a fresh `register`, decided at genesis if it must replace an
existing one — never a `module update`.

The table is the GENESIS path: the flag day that moves the root hash. There
is ONE source: `crates/topology/src/lib.rs`. Every binary composes from it
through `crates/noded/src/compose.rs` — `bin/node` from `PRODUCTION`, `bin/noded`
and `bin/simnode` from `SIM_BASE` (+ `SIM_VALSET` under simnode's
`--with-valset`) — so a wasm store-backed module touches no bin at all.

| Where | What to touch |
|---|---|
| `crates/topology/src/lib.rs` | a `ModuleSpec` row in `MODULES` (the id and its `code`) and the id in the selection(s) it joins. Everything else the host needs — backing, config keys, query mode — is the component's own `shape` export (see §2), so the row carries nothing a registry admission would lack. The siblings a module reads are compiled into its guest, not declared here; `host_state` composes genesis/restore/sync from the selection — nothing to mirror there. The component is NOT embedded: noded's build script stages `<id>.component.wasm` (and `<id>.index.wasm` for a crate carrying `src/index_guest.rs`) into the founding set beside the binary (`target/<profile>/modules`), and `node init` composes that set (`--modules <dir>`, default `$DUCKTAPE_MODULES_DIR`, else the staged set) into `<workspace>/genesis`, pinned by the descriptor. The kernel fixtures dir pins the same component bytes. |
| `crates/noded/src/compose.rs` | ONLY for a `Code::Native` tenant (an arm in `native`, plus the `Cargo.toml` dep) or an odb-declared tenant (an arm in `open_odb` opening its disk substrate, and its id in `ODB_SUBSTRATES`). A wasm store-backed module needs neither. |
| the indexer | `open_index_store` opens a database for EVERY id in the selection (and the host's composition opens one for every module the registry admitted since), so joining or leaving a selection gains or loses one — nothing to touch for a module with no mapper. A module that ships one carries `src/index_guest.rs` and joins `INDEX_MODULES` in the `Makefile`; the genesis carries the guest and the node converges it into the module's database at hydration (`converge_index_guests`, `crates/noded/src/index.rs`). |

`SIM_BASE` is 15 of production's 19; the four it leaves out — `acl`,
`governance`, `modules`, `valset` — are exactly what simnode's
`--with-valset` appends (with native `kv`). Decide which selection a new
module joins: `SIM_BASE` if it should boot by default (testable in sim-lane,
visible in the app), `SIM_VALSET` if it is governance-shaped.

A new module joins `topology::PRODUCTION`; update the topology's count and
membership pins and `host_state.rs`'s `GENESIS_ROOT_HASH` in the SAME commit
(the failing pin prints the new hex) and name the flag day in the message.

## 4. Gates — ordering is load-bearing

```
cargo test -p <id>                                        # 1. native logic
git push                                                  # 2. the guest build reads HEAD out of the repository
cargo run -p guest-builder -- crates/modules/<plane>/<id> # 3. catches native-dep leaks
make wasm-modules                                         # 4. BEFORE the node pins run —
                                                          #    the fixtures dir needs the artifact
cargo check --workspace --all-targets                     # 5. registry parity test gates
cargo clippy -p <id> --tests --no-deps                    #    topology↔composed-host drift
make wasm-modules-check                                   # 6. committed copies byte-identical, locks present
make wasm-rebuild-check                                   # 7. every guest matches a rebuild of its source (needs wasm32)
```

## Common mistakes

| Mistake | Reality |
|---|---|
| Adding the id to `PRODUCTION` only | noded/simnode compose `SIM_BASE`/`SIM_VALSET`; the module is invisible in daemon/sim lanes until it joins one of those too |
| Topology pins or `GENESIS_ROOT_HASH` left stale after adding/removing a module | `cargo test -p topology` and the root-hash pin fail; update both in the same commit |
| Guest added to root workspace members | guests are standalone BY DESIGN; membership poisons native feature unification |
| Node pins run before `make wasm-modules` | the fixtures dir lacks the component; `hash_bundle` refuses by name |
| Building a guest before pushing | guest-builder reads the module out of the repository at HEAD: an unpushed HEAD fails to fetch, an uncommitted edit is refused. Commit, push, then build |
| Moving the rust channel for one guest | bytes are toolchain-dependent; a channel move rebuilds the whole set (`make wasm-modules`) and commits it as one change |
| Touching `crates/module-sdk/src/lib.rs` without a rebuild | panic locations carry line numbers and every guest expands the SDK's macros, so even a comment line above them moves the set; `make wasm-rebuild-check` names the stale ones |
| Native-only dep in the module crate | wasm32 build breaks; gate it behind the `native` feature (the `files` shape) |
