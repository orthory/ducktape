//! Raw-HTTP-over-TCP test client + collision-safe port allocation + a coarse
//! event poll — the three helpers every node/daemon/sim integration harness in
//! the tree used to re-roll locally, now in ONE place.
//!
//! The node's app surface trusts localhost callers, so a hand-rolled std-TCP
//! http/1.1 client is a full citizen by design — the daemon's whole promise is
//! that ANY plain http client works. This crate IS that client, deduplicated,
//! so a suite that needs a raw request never re-writes a subtly-different (and
//! racier) variant. Dev/test only: no production crate depends on it.
//!
//! The body/head split is a BYTE-LEVEL scan for the `\r\n\r\n` terminator, never
//! a lossy utf-8 `split("\r\n\r\n")` — the former is correct for a binary chunk
//! body AND for a text body that itself contains a blank line; the latter
//! corrupts both. Port allocation holds every listener at once so the OS can't
//! hand the same port back twice. These are the safe variants; the racy/naive
//! copies are what this crate exists to kill.
