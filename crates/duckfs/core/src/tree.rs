//! copy-on-write tree editing (task 8): path walks over tree objects, rewrites
//! along the touched spine only, and the lazy overlay the commit executor (task
//! 9) drives.
//!
//! why lazy matters — the whole point of this engine. a [`TreeEdit`] loads the
//! root as a single unexpanded reference and only ever decodes the directories
//! on a path an op actually touches. an untouched subtree stays a
//! [`Node::Ref`], and at [`TreeEdit::build`] a `Ref` re-emits its existing
//! object id verbatim — never re-encoded. so an edit's cost is O(touched
//! spine), never O(namespace): touching one file in a million-entry tree
//! rewrites only that file's chain of parent directories, and every sibling
//! subtree is shared across versions by hash. that structural sharing is the
//! bedrock the storage model and gc (task 13) stand on — the untouched bytes of
//! version N are literally the same objects as version N-1.
//!
//! purity: no sdk, no `std::fs`, no async — this compiles under
//! `--no-default-features` as part of the future wasm core.

///    native's live `Pending::object_ids`, the guest's `__block_objects` re-seed)
///    is NOT charged — the kernel serves it from the same-block object-put
