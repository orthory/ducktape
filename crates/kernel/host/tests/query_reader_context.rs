//! The query context an authenticated read is answered in: WHO is asking, and
//! WHAT TIME the network agrees it is.
//!
//! Both are the module's only inputs for a protected read. `collaboration`
//! refuses `Origin::System` outright (the unauthenticated `/v1/query` lane
//! lands there). Deadline-sensitive readers also need the committed
//! `consensus_time`: a wrong clock makes a past deadline look future. This
//! harness probes that context; it does not implement collaboration eligibility.
//!
//! The clock is the subtler half. It advances ONLY at a committed block, and it
//! has to survive the two ways a host reaches a boundary without applying one:
//! a checkpoint reopen and a statesync install. Left at genesis after a restart
//! at height 40 000, every `now < expires_at` check reads as "nothing has
//! expired yet" — fail-open, in exactly the window after a restart.
