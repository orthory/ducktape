//! the STORE-BACKED cutover-continuity proof for capability: the `capability`
//! guest component over `WasmModule::with_store(QmdbStore)` and the native
//! `CapabilityRegistry` over the same store shape are ROOT-CONTINUOUS — the
//! same op sequence commits the IDENTICAL qmdb merkle root after every block
//! (both roots ARE the store's root; qmdb's batch canonicalizes mutations by
//! hashed key, so the native logical-key commit order and the wasm hashed-key
//! drain order produce the same op log). capability carries no per-network
//! genesis config, so both stores start empty and the genesis roots are
//! already equal.
//!
//! capability is MEMBER-GATED against a sibling, which is the point of this
//! tenant: every announce queries the valset module's live Validators AND
//! Residents projections through `ctx.query` before it may stage anything —
//! inside the guest those resolve through the wasm runtime's memoized-replay
//! machinery under real dispatch. both hosts therefore carry a REAL
//! `valset::Valset` seeded with test validators, and the matrix covers an
//! acceptance (member), an acceptance the RESIDENT union arm admits, and a
//! rejection (outsider) — all decided by sibling reads on the wasm side.
