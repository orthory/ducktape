//! the host — the deterministic state-machine spine.
//!
//! a [`Host`] owns a registry of [`Module`]s and turns an inbound [`Msg`] into a
//! block: it routes the message to its target module, awaits the (deterministic)
//! `execute`, then drains the intents that execute emitted. emitted [`Msg`]s are
//! re-dispatched as LOCAL-ONLY follow-up ops (never re-broadcast); emitted
//! [`Event`]s/[`Effect`]s are collected and handed back for the effectful node
//! layer (out of scope this slice). after the drain, the root-hash is recomposed
//! over the registry via [`global_root`].
//!
//! ## determinism
//!
//! `submit` is a pure function of `(registry state, msg, env)`:
//! - the registry is a [`BTreeMap`], so snapshot + root-hash iteration is sorted
//!   and order-stable across nodes;
//! - the follow-up queue is FIFO and dispatched purely locally;
//! - the drain is hard-capped at [`MAX_DISPATCHES`], so it always terminates
//!   (a self-emitting or A↔B-ping-pong module hits [`Error::BudgetExceeded`]
//!   rather than looping forever).
//!
//! ## the borrow seam (remove-execute-reinsert)
//!
//! executing module X needs `&mut X` while the [`Ctx`] must read the *other*
//! modules (for `query` routing). a `BTreeMap` can't hand out "one `&mut` + rest
//! `&`", so the host `remove`s the target — yielding an OWNED `Box<dyn Module>`
//! fully decoupled from the map — then borrows the remaining map into the ctx.
//! the owned module and the `&rest` borrow are disjoint, so they compose across
//! the `.await`. the module is reinserted before any error propagates, so it can
//! never vanish from the registry.
