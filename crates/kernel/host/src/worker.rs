//! the worker seam — the host-owned, NON-DETERMINISTIC lane beside the drain.
//!
//! the host's within-block drain is the DETERMINISTIC re-entry lane: `emit_msg`
//! follow-ups re-dispatch inside ONE block, one app-hash. this seam is the
//! non-deterministic lane: a block may emit [`Event`]s, and each event that a
//! [`Worker`] claims produces a follow-up op submitted as a SEPARATE block —
//! because on a real node it is a separate consensus transaction (the
//! oracle-as-op). that split — deterministic hops stay local and free, only
//! genuine external edges pay a round — is the whole design.
//!
//! this seam is domain-agnostic: it knows `Event` and `Msg`, nothing about
//! sagas. a [`Worker`] try-decodes an event it recognizes and, off to the
//! side (non-deterministically, in the real world), computes a result and
//! returns the op that carries it back. modules stay pure; only the worker is
//! impure, and the seam lives HERE on the host side, never inside a module
//! crate — so a module never depends on it. the drive loop itself lives with
//! each binary (validator drain, noded, simnode), which all follow the same
//! shape: submit, offer each emitted event to every worker, submit each
//! claimed follow-up as its own block. events a worker does NOT claim are the
//! plain observability stream — one lane, two consumer classes.
