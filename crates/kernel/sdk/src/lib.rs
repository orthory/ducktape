//! the module interface crate — the only universal dependency for modules.
//!
//! a super-app feature (documents, forge, chat, tasks, …) is an isolated module:
//! a crate that implements [`Module`] and normally depends on `sdk` plus
//! types-only interface crates for any modules it talks to. a narrow wrapper
//! exception exists for wrapper modules that reuse a shared storage
//! implementation. in embedded mode, all durable state must move through the
//! wrapper's [`StateRoot`], commit/abort, and sync boundary. in facade mode, the
//! storage implementation is an explicitly registered backing module and durable
//! state belongs to that backing module's root. the host composes each module's
//! [`StateRoot`] into the global root-hash (see `host::global_root`); how a module
//! *computes* that root — a qmdb merkle root, a git HEAD oid — is private to the
//! module. the host only ever sees `root() -> StateRoot`.
//!
//! this crate also carries the deterministic *system api*: the [`Ctx`] a module
//! touches during state-machine application (own-state r/w lives in `self`;
//! read-only cross-module [`Ctx::query`]/[`Ctx::module_root`]; the deterministic
//! [`Env`]; and intent emission via [`Ctx::emit_msg`]/[`Ctx::emit_event`] — an
//! event is ALSO the lane a host-side worker claims off-consensus work from).
//! the effectful node surface (real network/IO) is a separate layer and out of
//! scope here.
//!
//! keep this crate types + traits with no domain deps (async-trait is the one
//! greenlit exception): everything here is a shared surface for every module.
//! [`codec`] carries the shared zero-dep snapshot-codec primitives on the same
//! everyone-needs-it grounds, and [`genesis_config`] the tiny codec-based
//! GENESIS-CONFIG encoding the host and wasm guests share (per-network
//! parameters installed into a wasm tenant's consensus store at genesis).
