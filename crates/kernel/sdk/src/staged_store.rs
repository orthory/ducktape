//! the staged-over-committed overlay every qmdb-backed module shares.
//!
//! a disk-backed module (kv, pages, chat) is pure logic over a host-injected
//! [`MerkleStore`], with an in-block staging overlay in front of it: writes made
//! during `execute` are visible to later reads in the same block
//! (read-your-writes) but fold into the store — and the authenticated
//! [`StateRoot`] — only at `commit`. this type owns that overlay so the three
//! modules stop re-implementing the identical get/stage/delete/commit/abort loop
//! and the store-forwarding surface (root / serve_sync / sync_target).
//!
//! keys are LOGICAL (`Vec<u8>`) at this seam; the store key is `sha256(logical)`
//! — a fixed 32-byte digest, the canonical authenticated-KV pattern. hashing is
//! owned here so every module maps a logical key to the same store slot the same
//! way. the overlay value is `Option<Vec<u8>>`: `Some` upserts, `None` stages a
//! delete (a delete reads as absence and drops the key from the store at commit).
