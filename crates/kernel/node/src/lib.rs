// ============================================================================
// the ordering seam — an AGREED TOTAL ORDER over opaque op frames.
// ============================================================================
//
// ## why an agreed order (not gossip)
//
// a gossip path (apply a locally-originated msg IMMEDIATELY — the echo — then
// fan it out to peers) converges only for order-INdependent module roots (a
// state-based `directory` root). a qmdb root is op-log/MMR-order-DEPENDENT:
// the same SET of ops in different orders yields a different root, so the
// instant two validators apply in different orders their root-hash FORKS.
//
// the fix is an AGREED TOTAL ORDER. a locally-originated msg is **NOT** applied
// on submission — that optimistic echo is exactly what forks the chain the
// moment another validator's op orders first. instead the msg is proposed into
// the order via [`Orderer::submit`], and it is applied via `host.submit` ONLY
// when [`Orderer::poll_delivered`] delivers it — in the identical sequence on
// every validator, including its originator. so even an order-dependent qmdb
// root converges.
//
// ## precondition (the honest gap vs real BFT)
//
// [`RoundOrderer`] converges because every validator accumulates the IDENTICAL
// SET of frames before draining a round, then applies a deterministic,
// node-independent total order over that set. the harness guarantees the
// identical-set precondition by handing every node the same op-set (in different
// arrival orders); a real simplex finalization stream guarantees it for free
// (every honest node observes the same finalized-view sequence). the simplex
// `Orderer` is the drop-in behind this same trait — its `submit` is store.put +
// enqueue-digest, its `poll_delivered` non-blocking-drains the finalization
// stream. that is why `submit` is async here even though the deterministic body
// never suspends.
