//! node-side tx batch aggregation: many op-frames enqueued via `submit`, packed
//! by ONE `flush_batch` into a batch super-frame, and applied by
//! `drain_delivered` as ONE block — ONE height, ONE `pre_apply`, ONE seal, ONE
//! shared root-hash — with N per-member [`DrainedFrame`]s (one per op). the two
//! properties pinned here:
//!
//!  1. three distinct APPLYING frames in one batch => three DrainedFrames all at
//!     the SAME height, all with the SAME root-hash, DISTINCT FrameIds, exactly
//!     ONE BlockSeal recorded for that height, and the finalized boundary
//!     advanced by exactly one block;
//!  2. a mixed batch (a member rejects) => per-member Applied/Applied/Rejected at
//!     one shared height, and the block-level seal disposition is Applied because
//!     the batch MOVED state.
