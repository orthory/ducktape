//! network state sync: how a joiner rebuilds every module from a RUNNING node.
//!
//! ## role (unified-node design, phases 2-4)
//!
//! state sync is the JOIN-TIME BOOTSTRAP, not the steady state. a standing
//! node follows the head by FOLDING finalized frames (the replica pipeline:
//! verified certificates through `consensus::FollowerOrderer` into the same
//! `OrderedNode` a validator drains); these lanes serve exactly three
//! moments — standing a fresh joiner up at a boundary, the `Frames` suffix
//! that gives a bootstrap (or a fold-driver gap) journal continuity, and a
//! promotion's boundary artifacts. `MAX_CAPTURES` is sized for that
//! join-shaped load: concurrent joiners, not a resident fleet re-polling.
//!
//! ## protocol
//!
//! four request shapes ride one request/response transport (any transport —
//! a p2p channel, a socket, an in-process loopback — via [`SyncClient`]):
//!
//! 1. **Manifest** — the server captures a consistent view of its registry at
//!    its latest finalized boundary (height, root-hash, and per-module root +
//!    sync payload) and caches it; the response lists `(module, root, kind)`.
//!    everything in one capture comes from ONE boundary, so the payloads
//!    compose to exactly the manifest's root-hash.
//! 2. **Chunk** — fetch a captured module's snapshot payload in bounded chunks
//!    (snapshot bytes can exceed a transport's frame cap; chunking is the
//!    protocol's job, not the transport's).
//! 3. **Module** — route module-defined bytes to a live module's
//!    [`serve_sync`](sdk::Module::serve_sync): the qmdb op-range lane. served
//!    with HISTORICAL proofs, so an in-flight joiner target stays servable
//!    while the source keeps finalizing new blocks.
//! 4. **Frames** — fetch a bounded recovery-journal suffix: finalized,
//!    non-discarded frame bytes plus their seal roots/root-hash, so a promoted
//!    joiner can persist the same replay suffix a restart would have.
//! 5. **IndexOps** — the derived tier's OP-ROW BACKFILL (indexable spec §7):
//!    the serving node's stored index op rows below a joiner's boundary,
//!    cursor-paged in ascending key order. a joiner writes them into its own
//!    freshly-stamped index so its views hold pre-join history instead of
//!    beginning empty at the boundary. see the trust model — this is the one
//!    lane that is not verifiable.
//!
//! ## trust model
//!
//! the server is UNTRUSTED. every installable payload is verified by the
//! joiner against a root it obtained from the manifest — and the manifest's
//! root-hash is what the joiner ultimately recomposes and checks, so a lying
//! manifest fails the final compose. qmdb batches are merkle-verified by the
//! sync engine; snapshot installs re-derive the root before adopting bytes.
//! (the manifest root-hash itself is cross-checked against consensus when the
//! joiner later participates — a fabricated world still cannot vote.)
//!
//! the ONE exception is the index op-row lane: the derived tier has no root
//! by design (it is never part of the root-hash), so its rows cannot be
//! verified — a joiner trusts its OWN SYNC SOURCE for VIEW bytes only, the
//! same node it just accepted canonical state from. consensus state is
//! untouched either way, a lying row can never fork the node, and the honest
//! remedy for a bad backfill is the same as for any damaged index: wipe the
//! directory and let the boundary stamp answer honestly. what the lane still
//! enforces at the boundary is STRUCTURE ([`fetch_index_ops`]): key shape,
//! strictly ascending order, the boundary ceiling, and a decodable row
//! envelope — a source cannot make a joiner write garbage it would then fold.
//!
//! ## wire format
//!
//! compact hand-rolled binary (u64-le length prefixes, strict bounds checks,
//! no trailing bytes) — NOT serde_json: snapshot payloads are bulk bytes and
//! json inflates raw bytes ~3.7x, which would silently shrink the usable
//! chunk size under a transport frame cap.

// syncs by CONTENT-ADDRESSED FETCH: install the boundary refs image, then walk
// the reachable-but-absent object set (a BFS whose children are only revealed as
// their parents arrive), fetching each layer over the module's `serve_sync` lane
// until every reachable object is present. this crate is platform surface below
// the module crates, so it cannot name the module's types — the loop is generic
// over two seams the module (or the node glue) supplies:
//
//   * [`ModuleLane`]  — move one `serve_sync` request/response for the module.
//   * [`ObjectFetch`] — the module's install / missing / ingest / possession ops
//                       and its own request/response wire (encode/decode).
//
// the driver owns ONLY the control flow + the full-possession gate, so a joiner
// reports READY only once it holds every object — never on the refs alone.
