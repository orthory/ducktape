//! the p2p transport binding: a [`SyncClient`] over one commonware p2p channel.
//!
//! requests ride the rpc envelope (`id || frame`) addressed to ONE serving
//! peer at a time; a background dispatch task drains the channel receiver and
//! routes each response to its awaiting request by id. responses claiming to
//! be from a peer outside the candidate SOURCE set are dropped — the mesh is
//! authenticated, and installable payloads are root-verified anyway, but there
//! is no reason to let an unrelated peer complete someone else's request.
//!
//! SOURCE ROTATION: the client holds a candidate list, not a pinned server.
//! every payload is verified against consensus-agreed roots, so which peer
//! serves is purely an availability question — a request that fails at the
//! transport (unreachable send, reaper timeout) advances the cursor to the
//! next candidate and surfaces the error, and the caller's existing retry
//! (manifest loops, the qmdb refetch ladder) lands on the new source. one
//! failure advances the cursor once, no matter how many concurrent requests
//! observed it.
//!
//! every request is TIMED OUT by the dispatch task's reaper: p2p sends to a
//! peer whose link is not (or no longer) up are silently dropped by the mesh,
//! so an unanswered request must fail — the caller retries (a joiner's
//! manifest loop does exactly that while the mesh warms up) instead of parking
//! forever on a reply that will never come. the reaper lives in the dispatch
//! task because runtime contexts are move-only (not `Clone`): the spawned task
//! owns the only clock, and the request future itself stays runtime-free.
//!
//! BUSY-MESH RETRY: a single missed reaper window does not mean the source is
//! dead — a founder pushing tens of consensus blocks/s over the same overlay
//! can starve a statesync request in flight for a few seconds without either
//! side being wrong. [`send_request`](P2pSyncClient::send_request) therefore
//! retries the SAME request against the SAME source, stepping the reaper
//! window across [`RETRY_WINDOWS`] (3s → 6s → 12s) before it surfaces a
//! timeout and lets [`Sources::advance_past`] rotate the caller onto the next
//! candidate — a dead source is still abandoned within the bounded total (see
//! [`RETRY_WINDOWS`]'s doc), it just survives a merely busy mesh first. every
//! occurrence — each retried attempt and the final surfaced timeout alike —
//! bumps that source's timeout counter and, latched, a `warn!` (see
//! [`TIMEOUT_WARN_EVERY`]).
