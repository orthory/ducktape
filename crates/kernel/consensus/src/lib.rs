//! the real commonware-simplex BFT [`node::Orderer`].
//!
//! `SimplexOrderer` is a drop-in for `RoundOrderer` behind node's async
//! [`Orderer`](node::Orderer) trait, but the total order comes from a LIVE
//! simplex [`Engine`](commonware_consensus::simplex::Engine) reaching
//! `Activity::Finalization` — not a deterministic sort. it solves the three
//! seam-crossing costs INSIDE this one type:
//!
//! 1. **sync reporter -> async drain.** simplex's [`Reporter::report`] is SYNC
//!    (it runs inside the engine task) but host apply is async. so `report`
//!    resolves the finalized digest's bytes from the shared [`ContentStore`] and
//!    inserts `(finalized view -> frame bytes)` into an `Arc`-shared
//!    [`FinalizedInbox`]; the sync, non-blocking [`Orderer::poll_delivered`]
//!    (called by `OrderedNode`) drains that buffer in ASCENDING VIEW order (a
//!    `BTreeMap` keyed by view). the host applies in that agreed order.
//!
//! 2. **multi-op/multi-view liveness (peek-not-pop).** [`ConsensusAutomaton::
//!    propose`] PEEKS the front of this node's pending FIFO — it never pops. a
//!    leader view that nullifies before quorum keeps its queued digest and
//!    re-proposes next turn; the digest is removed at EXACTLY one point,
//!    finalization (in [`SimplexReporter::report`], by value not `pop_front`), so
//!    an op survives any number of nullified views yet applies at most once.
//!
//! 3. **payload availability.** simplex orders opaque `sha256(frame)` DIGESTS,
//!    not payloads. two constructors resolve the bytes behind a finalized digest:
//!    [`SimplexOrderer::spawn`] uses a [`NoopRelay`] over one shared
//!    [`ContentStore`] (the in-process-sim simplification — one store cloned into
//!    every validator), while [`SimplexOrderer::spawn_with_resolver`] runs a real
//!    [`ConsensusRelay`] over a PER-PROCESS store: the leader gossips a proposed
//!    frame's bytes at propose time, peers cache them STORE-ONLY (see
//!    [`spawn_payload_drain`]), and a lazy resolver fetch backstops any miss — so
//!    a non-proposer resolves a digest for an op it never originated. either way
//!    the ORDER comes purely from finalization; the store only resolves an
//!    already-agreed digest back to bytes.
//!
//! the whole thing is additive: `node::Orderer` / `OrderedNode` / the frame
//! codec / `RoundOrderer` are all UNCHANGED — `SimplexOrderer` slots in behind
//! the identical trait.

// down the current engine and RE-SPAWNS a new one with the new
// `(scheme, participants)`. finalizing the switch through the old engine
// FIRST is what makes every node cut over at the SAME point (else they fork).
// this one teardown-and-respawn mechanism backs both a scheme change and
