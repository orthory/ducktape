//! The data plane: off-consensus byte transport between nodes, designed to
//! ride the reachability plane's WireGuard overlay (`dt-*` interface,
//! fd::/48 ULA, per-peer /128 AllowedIPs).
//!
//! Wire surface (this crate root): [`Service`] ids, the datagram header and
//! stream hello frames in [`wire`], and [`flow::FlowId`] derivation. Peers
//! must agree on all three; everything else is node-local policy.
//!
//! Boundary — what this plane is and is not:
//! - It carries **opaque bytes off-consensus**. Nothing here is BFT-ordered,
//!   nothing lands in replicated state. Durable sent/received facts, when a
//!   consumer needs them, are ordinary module ops on the consensus lane —
//!   outside this crate.
//! - **Admission derives from consensus.** A flow is admissible only if the
//!   injected [`plane::AdmissionPolicy`] — a node-layer view over finalized
//!   module state (channel membership, valset, ...) — permits the
//!   `(peer, service, flow)` triple. Default-deny: unadmitted traffic is
//!   dropped at demux, counted, and attributed to its sender; it never
//!   reaches a consumer queue. There is no raw send surface either — the
//!   only way to emit traffic is through a flow handle, and every send is
//!   admission-checked, so a correct node cannot unknowingly send rogue
//!   traffic.
//! - **Identity is the transport's.** On the real overlay, WireGuard
//!   cryptokey routing binds a packet's source /128 to exactly one peer, so
//!   [`transport::PeerId`] arrives authenticated; this crate adds no session
//!   crypto and no handshake beyond the one-frame stream hello.
//!
//! Two service classes, two APIs, never unified:
//! - **Datagram class** — unreliable, unordered, latency-first (voice).
//!   Per-flow bounded queues, drop-oldest: late real-time data is dead data.
//! - **Stream class** — reliable, backpressured, throughput-with-headroom
//!   (state sync, blob fetch). Every stream's writes draw from one global
//!   bulk token bucket so bulk self-limits below the link and real-time
//!   traffic never queues behind it.
