//! `step`: the one visible dispatch. Every `(Phase, Event)` pair is routed
//! by the single `match` in [`step`] to a handler named for the pair; the
//! pairs that mean nothing in a phase are listed there too and leave the
//! phase unchanged with no commands. No `_` arm: a new `Event` or `Phase`
//! variant must fail the build until it is routed (a source-parsing test in
//! this file holds that shape).
//!
//! Handlers DECIDE and return the next phase plus commands; they never
//! perform an effect. The executor performs the commands in order.
//!
//! The flows, as the executor sees them:
//! - `Idle` + `Tick` → `Fetch`; `ManifestFetched(Ok)` newer-or-equal to the
//!   pin with a host artifact that is not `current` → `Downloading` +
//!   `Download`; `DownloadFinished` → `Verify`; `Verified` →
//!   `SealImmutable` (+ `PinSuccessor`) → `Staged` + `Banner(Ready)`.
//! - `RestartToUpdate`, or `Boot` while `Staged` → `Qualify`;
//!   `QualifyPassed` → `Persist(Swapping)` → `Flip` →
//!   `Persist(PendingHealthy{boots: 0})` → `Exec`; `QualifyFailed` → stay
//!   `Staged`, `Banner` names the reason.
//! - `PendingHealthy` + `Rendered` → `Idle` + `Gc`. `Boot` with `boots == 0`
//!   → `boots: 1`; `Boot` with `boots ≥ 1` → flip back → `RolledBack` →
//!   `Exec`. `Boot` while `Swapping` → `ResolveSwap`; `SwapResolved` finishes
//!   the swap from whichever side landed.
//! - `UserRollback` while `Idle` with a `previous` → the same swap into
//!   `previous`, `current` becoming the new `previous`. `pinned_sequence`
//!   never lowers: the next `Tick` re-offers the same release.
//! - A boot whose command list carries no `Exec` execs [`Phase::current`].
