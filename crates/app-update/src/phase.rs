//! The update state machine's vocabulary: `Phase` (persisted verbatim as
//! `state.json`), `Event` (every input, one enum) and `Command` (every
//! effect, executed in order by ONE executor per process).
//!
//! Two processes drive the machine and never at the same time — the
//! launcher at boot, then `exec` replaces it with the app. `state.json` plus
//! two env vars (`DUCKTAPE_RELEASE`, `DUCKTAPE_UPDATE_STATE`) are their whole
//! contract. Paths are the executor's: every command names a release by its
//! `Sha` and the executor maps that to `releases/<sha>/` (or `<sha>.partial`).
