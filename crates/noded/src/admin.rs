//! the owner-gated control namespace — the node's PRIVATE RPC surface.
//! everything under `/v1/admin/*` is CONTROL, not data: lifecycle,
//! code/upgrade staging, diagnostics. it is a NAMESPACE on the SAME listener
//! (geth `admin_` spirit), never a second port, gated as a unit by one
//! middleware ([`admin_guard`]) layered onto the admin sub-router alone.
//!
//! ## the exposure ladder ([`AdminExposure`], flag `DUCKTAPE_ADMIN`)
//!
//! - `Disabled` unregisters the routes entirely — the surface is simply ABSENT
//!   (`router` never merges them), a 404, not a gated-but-present 403.
//! - `Loopback` (the default): reachable only from loopback peers, AND the peer
//!   must present the operator credential ([`ADMIN_TOKEN_HEADER`]).
//! - `Public`: reachable off-box, so the OWNER gate is the ONLY thing
//!   standing between a remote caller and node control — enforced for every
//!   peer. this is the new capability W2 adds, and the case PoP exists for.
//!
//! the EXPOSURE picks the arm, and nothing else does — ownership is not even
//! looked up under `Loopback`. so a node with a committed owner still takes the
//! operator credential at the default exposure; the owner PoP becomes the
//! credential when, and only when, the operator sets `DUCKTAPE_ADMIN=public`.
//! the two are a LADDER, never an OR: under `Public` with an owner committed,
//! the operator token is not a fallback and not accepted (a token-only request
//! is `owner_signature_invalid`, which is how an operator tells "wrong
//! credential type" from `operator_token_mismatch`'s "wrong secret").
//!
//! ## the operator gate — why loopback presence is NOT authority
//!
//! loopback used to BE the gate here, on the reasoning `origin_guard` states for
//! itself: a local process can read `user.key` off disk anyway. that reasoning
//! broke when compute, agent and airlock became separate local daemon
//! processes — three long-lived programs now sit exactly where "any loopback
//! peer" points, and any of them could `POST /v1/admin/shutdown` or stage module
//! wasm without ever asking for a grant.
//!
//! so admin requires what the node's OWN workspace requires: a secret minted
//! fresh each boot and written 0600 beside `node.toml` ([`mint_operator_token`]).
//! that is the SAME bar, and the same mechanism, `service-link.token` already
//! sets for the interactive plane (`crate::services::mint_link_token`) — the
//! compare is literally `crate::services::token_matches`. it raises admin from
//! "can dial loopback" to "can read the node's own workspace".
//!
//! CEILING, stated rather than assumed — and it is NOT that the service daemons
//! are now excluded. `ducktape service run <kind>` resolves a workspace and
//! reads `service-link.token` out of it (`bin/node/src/agent/link.rs`), so a
//! daemon launched with the workspace path sits in the same directory, at the
//! same uid, behind the same 0600 mode as `admin.token`: it still clears this
//! bar, because nothing in-process can gate a `read(2)` by the same uid. what
//! this gate actually excludes is EVERY OTHER local process on the box — which
//! is the "can dial loopback" half, and was the whole of the gate before. the
//! residual is the uid/workspace boundary, and bounding it is the launch
//! contract's job (start a daemon with a base URL, never with `--config`).
//!
//! ## the owner gate (A5, only under `Public`)
//!
//! a per-request proof-of-possession (PoP) by the owner account's key, verified
//! statelessly against a PUBLIC pin — the coordinator auth pattern (#197). the
//! owner is the OPERATOR's statement plus a chain fact: identity binds no node
//! to an account, so the node boots with the operator's own wallet key
//! ([`AdminConfig::owner_key`]) and the account THAT key is on (identity
//! `OfKey`) owns the control plane; the request's key must be one of that
//! account's member keys.
//!
//! ## the bootstrap window
//!
//! a `Public` node whose operator key is on NO account yet (fresh network,
//! before `ducktape account create`) has nobody to authenticate against, so
//! admin falls back to the operator gate until the account exists — never
//! drivable off-box with no check at all, collapsing to the full owner gate
//! the instant the account does. the embedded single-writer daemon
//! (`node_key = None`, no consensus) and a host with no wallet
//! (`owner_key = None`) can only ever be operator-gated.
//!
//! ## the PoP wire (mirrors `nat-traversal::auth`)
//!
//! sign [`ADMIN_REQ_NS`] over
//! `method ‖ 0x1f ‖ path_and_query ‖ 0x1f ‖ node_key ‖ 0x1f ‖ ts_be` — the
//! TARGET NODE's consensus key is folded in, so a signature minted for node X
//! can never be replayed against another node the same owner controls.
//! headers carry the account key, the timestamp and the signature. the BODY is
//! deliberately NOT signed: `module-code/stage` streams a large artifact the
//! store never parks in memory, and buffering it in middleware to hash it would
//! regress that. ceiling: on a non-TLS `Public` exposure a network attacker can
//! tamper an owner-issued request's body within the freshness window — TLS
//! termination is the operator's job for hostile-network exposure.
//! ponytail: method+path+node+ts PoP, not body; 30s replay window; TLS is the op's job.
//!
//! NEVER front a `Loopback`-exposure node with a reverse proxy: the proxy's
//! loopback dial would launder every remote caller into a trusted local peer.
//! Off-box access is `Public` + owner PoP (+ operator TLS), nothing else.
