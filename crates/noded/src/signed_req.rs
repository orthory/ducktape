//! the ONE per-request proof-of-possession (PoP) this node verifies, and the
//! gate that requires one on every MUTATING `/v1` route.
//!
//! ## why a signature and not a token
//!
//! a mutating request changes committed state, the node's own files, or a
//! process it hosts. "can dial this port" is not authority for any of that:
//! loopback is precisely what the audit found trusted, and widening
//! `http_listen` hands the whole surface to anyone who can open a socket. so a
//! mutation carries a signature by the key that is ACTING, and the node
//! verifies it before the handler runs. reads stay open.
//!
//! ## two namespaces, one verifier
//!
//! `/v1/admin/*` (control: shutdown, module code, log tail) already had this
//! shape ([`crate::admin`]). the data plane needs the same primitive with a
//! DIFFERENT bind, so the verifier lives here and each namespace owns its own
//! signing namespace and message:
//!
//! - control: [`crate::admin::ADMIN_REQ_NS`] over `method ‖ path ‖ node ‖ ts`.
//!   the body is deliberately unsigned there — `module-code/stage` streams a
//!   large artifact the gate must not buffer.
//! - data: [`DATA_REQ_NS`] over `method ‖ path ‖ node ‖ ts ‖ sha256(body)`.
//!   every gated body is already buffered by its handler (they all take
//!   `Bytes`/`Json`), and the WHOLE POINT of this gate is that the bytes a
//!   caller signed for are the bytes that land — an unsigned body would let a
//!   network attacker swap the chunk, the commit's changes, or the object.
//!
//! a signature is bound to the TARGET NODE's consensus key, so one minted for
//! node X never replays against node Y; and to a timestamp inside
//! [`FRESHNESS_SECS`], so a captured request dies with the window.
//!
//! ## the second credential: the node's OWN daemons
//!
//! some mutations are the NODE's, not a person's. a capability announce keys
//! the registry on the submitting node; a compute lease heartbeat and bid are
//! held BY the node; an agent run's provisioner writes duckfs on the node's
//! behalf. a user signature there would name the WRONG actor, so those callers
//! present what `/v1/admin/*` already asks of a local daemon
//! ([`crate::admin::ADMIN_TOKEN_HEADER`]): this boot's 0600 workspace secret,
//! from a loopback peer. "can read the node's own workspace", never "can dial
//! the port" — a sandbox guest, which reaches this listener through a vsock
//! tunnel with no workspace, cannot read it.
//!
//! ## TWO layers, because a PoP is not a credential
//!
//! a PoP proves POSSESSION of the key named in the headers and nothing else:
//! there is no ACL read here, so ANY well-formed key may act — a caller with no
//! standing anywhere mints a keypair and signs. that is the right bar for a
//! MODULE-BOUND mutation, where the verified key becomes the op's
//! `Origin::External` ([`SignedBy`]) and the module's own `check_authority`
//! decides; it is the same bar `/v1/submit/frame` sets.
//!
//! it is NOT a bar at all for a mutation that changes the NODE — minting a
//! mesh invite, retuning the process-wide log filter, spawning a host pty,
//! deleting a managed checkout dir. those handlers read no acting identity,
//! so "any well-formed key" is "anyone who can dial the port", the sandbox
//! guest's tunnelled loopback included. so [`Lane::authority`] classifies every
//! mutating route, and a [`Authority::Operator`] one admits only:
//!
//! - the operator credential above, or
//! - a PoP by the key this node knows as its operator's
//!   ([`crate::AdminConfig::owner_key`] — the active wallet key read from this
//!   host's keystore at boot, which is what `ducktape node log-filter` signs
//!   with). no wallet on the host = no such key = the token is the only way in.
//!
//! nothing else. which credential was presented decides the ACTING identity: a
//! signature acts as its key, the operator credential acts as the node.
//!
//! ponytail: possession per module, operator-key equality for the node's own
//! mutations; 30s replay window; TLS is the op's job.
