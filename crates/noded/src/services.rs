//! The node-local service catalog: which offchain service daemons are
//! currently signaling presence to this node.
//!
//! A service (compute, storage, ...) has no sovereign identity — identity and
//! transport belong to the node — so it cannot place itself on chain and it
//! cannot name itself. All it may do is SIGNAL: `POST /v1/services/hello`
//! declaring its kind, version, the capability tags it offers and the grant
//! scopes it needs. The node remembers that for [`HELLO_TTL`] and nothing
//! more. Nothing here is durable, nothing here is consensus state, and an
//! entry confers no standing whatsoever — `ducktape service enable <kind>`
//! (which writes the workspace's `services.toml`) is the consent boundary.
//!
//! ## why a TTL and not a live connection
//!
//! Presence could ride an open websocket, but `stream_session` has no
//! disconnect seam — every teardown path is a bare `return` — so a connection
//! model would be the first of its kind in the daemon. A refreshed deadline is
//! the shape two existing registries already use (`gateway_ws_token`'s
//! prune-on-write, `nat_traversal::AdvertBook`'s expire-on-read), so a hello
//! that stops arriving simply ages out.
