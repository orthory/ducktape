//! the process-wide log subscriber: ONE filter, two sinks, retunable live.
//!
//! this lives in the noded LIB because the three binaries that install it —
//! `bin/node`, `bin/noded`, `bin/simnode` — already depend on it (they serve
//! `noded::router`). `bin/coordinator` deliberately does not (its Cargo.toml:
//! "no node-crate dependency"); it emits no events yet, so it gets its own
//! subscriber when it gets its first one, rather than inverting that boundary
//! for a constructor. `bin/fs` and `bin/mcp` are CLIs whose stdout IS their wire
//! (a duckfs command's output, JSON-RPC) — program output is not logging.
//!
//! events reach TWO places, both gated by the same filter:
//!
//! - stderr: the spawner tees it into `<workspace>/daemon.log` — the durable
//!   record, and it survives a crash because stderr is unbuffered.
//! - [`crate::LogRing`]: the ws `logs` topic, i.e. the desktop app's Logs tab —
//!   the live tail.
