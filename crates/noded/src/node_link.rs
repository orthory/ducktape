//! `NodeLink` — a service daemon's handle on the node it serves.
//!
//! The compute plane runs OUT OF PROCESS now (`ducktape service run compute`),
//! so everything it used to reach through the in-process [`crate::NodeHandle`]
//! actor lane travels the node's own `/v1` surface instead. This is the one
//! place that mapping lives:
//!
//! | actor command | `/v1` route |
//! |---|---|
//! | `NodeCommand::Submit` | `POST /v1/submit` — the node re-signs with ITS key |
//! | `NodeCommand::SubmitFrame` | `POST /v1/submit/frame` — verbatim, signer verified |
//! | `NodeCommand::Query` | `POST /v1/query` — committed module state |
//! | `ActorNodeApi` (duckfs engine) | [`duckfs_client::http::HttpNode`] |
//!
//! The `origin` field of `/v1/submit` is deliberately not sent: `bin/node`
//! discards it and frames the op with the node key, which is exactly the
//! identity a saga lease is held under. That equivalence is the whole reason a
//! daemon needs no keypair of its own — and it is exactly why `/v1/submit`
//! takes the OPERATOR credential (`signed_req`'s `Authority::Operator`, #1808)
//! rather than any acting key: `submit` below rides [`Self::post_json`], which
//! attaches it on every call via [`Self::credentialed`].
//!
//! Two things stay host-local paths rather than `/v1` calls, because they are
//! host resources and not node state: the guest images a run boots from, and
//! the forge module's materialized bare repos (`<storage>/forge-repo`), which
//! the worktree lane clones from directly. A daemon that boots this host's VMs
//! is already on this host.
