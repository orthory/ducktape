//! Forge as a module-owned view: the repo overview, one repo's code, pull
//! requests and issues, and an item's merge box, reviews and discussion,
//! all read off the node through the kernel contract. Opening a repo, an
//! item, a directory or a file is this view's own state and its own read; a
//! review and a merge leave as `op.submit`, signed by the kernel with the
//! seated key. The app holds no forge state at all.
