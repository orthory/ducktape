//! Chat as a module-owned view: the channel sidebar, the message stream,
//! the thread rail and the channel-details drawer, from the facts the
//! desktop app pushes. Every act — a room, a reaction, an edit, a search —
//! leaves as an intent the app signs; the two composers are the app's own
//! surfaces, left as slots.
