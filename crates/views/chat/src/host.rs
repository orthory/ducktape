//! What the chat view asks of the host kernel, the rows it folds off its own
//! reads, and the writes that leave as `op.submit`.
//!
//! The kernel pushes SESSION facts only (`chat.props`): the connection, the
//! reader, the sidebar the rest of the app also draws from, the huddle (native
//! media), the agent runs in flight in this process, and the sends the
//! composer surface has admitted but not yet landed. Everything ABOUT the room
//! on screen — its record, its roster, its messages, its threads and its
//! search — this view reads for itself through `rpc.view`, re-read on every
//! `rpc.live` hit for the chat plane. A reaction, a delete, a rename, an
//! archive or a membership change leaves as `op.submit` carrying chat's own
//! message, signed by the kernel with the seated key: the view never sees the
//! key, the endpoint or the password.
