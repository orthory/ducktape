//! The document text and the block records are the same page in two shapes.
//! This module is the translation, both ways, plus the plan that turns an
//! edited buffer back into the module's own ops.
//!
//! WHY THERE IS NO TREE DIFF HERE. `RemoveBlock` deletes the whole SUBTREE
//! (pages `block_ops::delete_subtree`), and the submit path gives no ordering
//! guarantee across separate requests. A general "reconcile any two trees"
//! engine would have to reparent, and getting that wrong destroys committed
//! records on an append-only chain. So nesting is NEVER inferred from the text:
//! an inserted line adopts the depth of the line above it, depth changes stay
//! explicit `MoveBlock` ops from Tab/Shift+Tab, and a removal that would take a
//! block still holding children is REFUSED rather than guessed at.
//!
//! The pairing is a prefix/suffix trim, not an LCS: equal lines at the head and
//! tail keep their block ids (so a comment anchored to a paragraph survives an
//! edit three lines above it), and only the disturbed middle is paired by
//! position. A wholesale reshuffle costs some ids; it never costs text.
