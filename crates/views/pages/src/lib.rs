//! Pages owns its whole screen: the page list, the document editor, Markdown
//! presentation, selection and undo history, the comment rail, and every read
//! and write behind them. It speaks the kernel contract — `rpc.view` and
//! `rpc.live` for the workspace, `op.submit` for the pages module's own ops —
//! so the desktop app carries no pages code at all.
