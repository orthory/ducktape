//! airlock — the barrier between execution and auth. A sandbox runs on one side
//! and the credential lives on the other; nothing crosses without an attested,
//! session-scoped handshake.
//!
//! The default build is pure — no IO, no async — and is what `airlock-gateway`
//! builds on. The optional `client` feature adds the async HTTP client side of
//! the handshake (`client::Gateway`), shared by `broker-host` and
//! `ducktape user cred`.
