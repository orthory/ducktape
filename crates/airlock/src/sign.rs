//! The `POST /sign/macos-bundle` pipeline: sign, notarize and staple an
//! UNSIGNED `Ducktape.app` with an admitted [`AppleCodesign`] identity, inside
//! the gateway, so the identity never leaves it.
//!
//! The pipeline is ONE state machine, [`Stage`] by [`Stage`]:
//!
//! ```text
//! Received ─validate─▶ Validated ─sign─▶ Signed ─notarize─▶ Notarized ─staple─▶ Stapled ─pack─▶ done
//!     │                    │               │                    │                  │
//!     └────────────────────┴───────────────┴────────────────────┴──────────────────┴──▶ Refused
//! ```
//!
//! [`advance`] is the table (pure: a stage and what its step reported in, the
//! next stage or the terminal answer out); [`Job::step`] is the one visible
//! dispatch that runs a stage's effect; [`sign_bundle`] is the executor that
//! walks them. Every refusal is a [`Refusal`] token, never prose.
//!
//! Order matters and is the whole design: the bundle's SHAPE is checked
//! before the identity is touched, so a malformed upload never gets the p12
//! written to disk; the identity is materialized into a private 0700
//! directory under the tmpfs root only for the `rcodesign` runs, and that
//! directory is removed on every exit path (it is a [`tempfile::TempDir`],
//! dropped with the job).
//!
//! `rcodesign` is a BINARY in the gateway image, not a library in the
//! measured enclave binary (`ops/airlock-gateway/install-rcodesign.sh`
//! installs the pinned release beside it). A gateway whose image lacks it
//! refuses by name (`tool_missing`) rather than serving a route it cannot
//! honour.
//!
//! Two commands do the Apple half, so a rejection and a staple failure are
//! separate stages with separate tokens:
//!
//! ```text
//! rcodesign sign --p12-file identity.p12 --p12-password-file p12.password \
//!     --code-signature-flags runtime \
//!     --code-signature-flags Contents/MacOS/ducktape-app:runtime \
//!     --entitlements-xml-file <entitlements> \
//!     --entitlements-xml-file Contents/MacOS/ducktape-app:<entitlements> \
//!     Ducktape.app
//! rcodesign notary-submit --api-key-file api-key.json --wait Ducktape.app
//! rcodesign staple Ducktape.app
//! ```
//!
//! The scoped flags mirror `ops/bundle-app-macos.sh`, which signs the nested
//! `ducktape-app` and then the bundle, each with the hardened runtime and the
//! same entitlements: `rcodesign` applies an unscoped setting to the main
//! executable only. `--for-notarization` is NOT passed: it refuses any
//! certificate Apple did not issue, which would make the sign step
//! unexercisable with a throwaway identity, and every check it adds is
//! already made elsewhere — the Developer ID marker and team at admission
//! (`codesign::AppleCodesign::admit`), the runtime flag here, the time-stamp
//! by the default server, and the rest by Apple's notary service itself.
