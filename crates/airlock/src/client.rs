//! The async HTTP client side of the gateway protocol, shared by
//! `ducktape user cred inspect|seal` (the credential-provider verbs) and
//! `broker-host` (the Computation Provider's local api-snatch).
//! Topology-agnostic: a `Gateway` is either LOCAL (same-machine
//! loopback) or REMOTE (a duckdns handle routed by the local node's
//! browser-gateway, carried in `x-duck-authority`).
//!
//! Vendor-specific quote VERIFICATION stays in the binaries (it needs
//! `dcap-qvl` for TDX etc.); this module owns only the transport + the ECDH
//! handshake, which take an already-verified `seal_pk`.
