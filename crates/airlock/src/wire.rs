//! HTTP wire types between host and client. Plain HTTP for the PoC; the
//! transport drops onto duckdns + a gateway RouteRecord in the integration
//! spec.
//!
//! Every type here is STRICT: `deny_unknown_fields`, and no `serde(default)`
//! anywhere. The protocol decodes each frame at its boundary, so a producer
//! that is out of step gets a named decode error instead of a silently
//! defaulted field.
//!
//! Nothing here carries an ACCOUNT. A session request names the credential and
//! the session's ephemeral key, and says nothing about who is acting: identity
//! enters the flow at exactly one place, the gateway hop, where the node stamps
//! a mesh-verified caller the request cannot mint. A field for the caller to
//! declare its own account was the whole of the credential-theft defect.
//!
//! [`WorkRef`] is not a reopening of that. It is a POINTER — an id the lender
//! resolves in its OWN committed state — and every fact it yields is read from
//! consensus, never from the request. See its own docs.
