//! The plane controller: demux, admission, per-flow queues, bulk pacing.
//!
//! All isolation lives here, above the transport seam:
//! - **Class isolation** is structural (separate datagram/stream paths in
//!   the transport).
//! - **Link isolation**: every stream write draws from one global bulk
//!   token bucket, so bulk self-limits below the link and never queues
//!   ahead of real-time datagrams.
//! - **Flow isolation**: per-flow bounded queues; a datagram flow overflows
//!   by dropping its own oldest, never a neighbor's.
//! - **Admission** (consensus-derived, injected): default-deny on receive
//!   AND send. Unadmitted traffic is dropped at demux, counted, and
//!   attributed; a correct node cannot emit rogue traffic because flow
//!   handles are the only send surface.
