//! Observing open planes: a weak per-plane watch handle and the
//! process-wide [`PlaneMonitor`] that attributes every open plane to the
//! module that created it.
//!
//! Planes are per-use and subsystem-owned, so there
//! is deliberately no central object that OWNS them — the monitor only
//! watches. Each creator registers its plane right after bring-up with the
//! module name that opened it; a [`PlaneWatch`] holds a weak reference, so
//! registration never extends a plane's life, and a snapshot self-prunes
//! entries whose plane is gone.
