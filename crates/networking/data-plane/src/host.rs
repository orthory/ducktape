//! Host-lifecycle helpers for per-use planes (per-use data-plane ADR,
//! `docs/adr/2026-07-07-per-use-data-plane.mdx`): every service binds the
//! same way — compute its overlay addresses, retry the bind until the
//! reachability plane's interface (and this node's `/128`) exists,
//! construct the [`DataPlane`], and register its stream service. Only
//! admission, the address book, and the accept/serve loop differ per
//! service — callers keep those; this owns the shared bring-up core so it
//! is written once instead of once per [`Service`] consumer.
