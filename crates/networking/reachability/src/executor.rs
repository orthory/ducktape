//! The host executor: drives the netstack machine over the node's
//! command/event channels and PERFORMS what it decides — mesh sends,
//! interface pushes (through a [`WireGuardEffect`]), resolver operations
//! (through an [`EndpointResolver`]), command replies, and persisted-mesh
//! writes. Everything the machine is not allowed to touch lives here: the
//! clock stamp, the filesystem, the sockets, the WireGuard private key.
//!
//! Runtime contract: the node runs [`run`] as the ROOT future of a dedicated
//! plain-tokio runtime on its own OS thread (the same split as the node's
//! app-surface thread), talking to the commonware runner over the two mpsc
//! channels. The future is not required to be `Send` — nothing here may
//! assume `tokio::spawn` onto a shared runtime, so the resolver runs as an
//! in-future PUMP joined with the command loop: resolver operations queue to
//! it and their completions feed back as machine events. That split is what
//! keeps a slow resolve from stalling the plane — commands keep draining
//! while an operation is in flight — while resolver operations themselves
//! stay serialized in start order, and it needs neither `Send` nor
//! `'static` from the resolver.
//!
//! One machine obligation is honored HERE: an interface push
//! ([`Effect::WgApply`]) is performed synchronously and its outcome stepped
//! back into the machine before anything else drains, so a push round-trips
//! inside the step cascade that requested it.
//!
//! The machine is driven through [`NetstackMachine`], so the loop never
//! learns whether it holds the native [`Machine`] or the wasm guest
//! ([`NetstackBackend`]). The one difference it handles: a backend can
//! FAULT (a trap, an exhausted budget), after which its state is unknown —
//! the loop says so, hands the plane to the native machine, and replays
//! the last retarget so the epoch re-assembles live.
