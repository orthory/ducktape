//! The netstack machine's frozen lifecycle suite. [`harness`] is the pure
//! world every scenario runs in; [`scenarios`] are the lifecycles
//! themselves, each pinned as a golden event→effect trace under
//! `fixtures/<scenario>.trace`. The trace IS the specification: a behavior
//! change is a PR that regenerates it (`UPDATE_TRACES=1 cargo test -p
//! netstack-scenarios`), and the review reads the fixture diff.
//!
//! The suite is generic over the [`Backend`] that builds each node's
//! machine, so ONE fixture set binds every backend: the native machine (this
//! crate's tests), the wasm guest (`netstack-wasm`'s), and every crossing
//! between them a mid-life swap makes. A backend whose trace differs by a
//! byte fails exactly the way a behavior change does.
