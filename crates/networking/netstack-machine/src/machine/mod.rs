//! The machine itself: one visible dispatch over every [`Event`], a
//! cross-epoch [`Driver`] holding the few writers every effect goes
//! through, and the per-epoch state ([`crate::epoch::EpochState`]) the
//! handlers decide over.
//!
//! Layout: `mod.rs` is the dispatch and the writers; the protocol areas
//! live beside it — `restore` (retarget + the cold-restart re-apply),
//! `gossip` (member phase-A records/adverts + live re-advertisement),
//! `prewarm` (the standby layer, both roles), `handshake` (the signed
//! triple + relay routing), `steps` (the epoch step executors: advert
//! signing, mesh verification, adoption, the epoch apply), `invite` (the
//! join-window layer), `nudge` (re-offers, heals, the rendezvous sweeps),
//! and `pending` (the parked-work vocabulary).
//!
//! The per-epoch data and every pure decision over it (phase, next step,
//! nudge re-offers, nonce admission, relay slotting, the rendezvous budget)
//! live in [`crate::epoch`]; this module EXECUTES what those decisions say
//! by buffering effects.
