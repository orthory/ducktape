//! Retargeting and the cold-restart restore: bind a fresh epoch on every
//! cutover, and — once per host life, on the boot retarget — bring the LAST
//! applied epoch's tunnels back from the persisted mesh so plane gossip has
//! a path on a node that restarted with zero TCP links (NATed member whose
//! join ingress is gone; whole-network cold start).
//!
//! The restore is the machine's one PRE-EPOCH suspension: the remembered
//! records' endpoints re-resolve FRESH through the coordinator (a persisted
//! punch observation died with the downtime's NAT mappings), those resolves
//! join into one interface push, and only then does the retarget tail build
//! the epoch. Events delivered in that window find no epoch and drop — the
//! same fate they had while the old blocking restore held the command
//! queue — and the nudge re-offers heal whatever that window cost.
