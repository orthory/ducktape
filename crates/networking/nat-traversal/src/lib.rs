//! nat-traversal: reflexive-address discovery + UDP hole-punch mediated by an
//! untrusted coordinator. No WireGuard, no consensus — the reachability
//! primitive under the private-cutover epic. The coordinator is rendezvous
//! ONLY (STUN-style reflexive observation + punch brokering): it never carries
//! peer traffic, so no data path ever depends on it. The one deliberate
//! exception is the `relay` lane's SEALED join intro: on a UDP-dead network a
//! joiner rides TCP to the coordinator, which forwards the opaque sealed bytes
//! (it cannot read them) as a single datagram — a bootstrap fallback, never a
//! peer data path.
