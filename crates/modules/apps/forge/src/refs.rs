//! per-repo MULTI-BRANCH state — the flag-day generalization of the phase-1
//! single-`main` [`RepoState`].
//!
//! consensus state per repo is now a sorted map of born branches
//! (`short_name -> head oid`); `main` and the shared `dev` integration branch
//! are protected (never deleted, fast-forward-guarded at materialize time),
//! while feature branches are plain CAS-guarded refs that may force-push or be
//! deleted — the GitHub flow (`git push origin feature/x`, open a PR from it).
//!
//! the phase-1 determinism invariant carries over PER BRANCH: consensus only
//! ever gates on a compare-and-swap against a branch's COMMITTED head; packs,
//! closures, and descent checks stay node-local catch-up, never accept/reject.
//!
//! the CAS gate and the staged fates are the pure consensus half (the wasm
//! guest runs them); publishing to the on-disk git ref and materializing packs
//! is the `native` substrate's half.
