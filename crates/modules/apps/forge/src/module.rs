//! the NATIVE forge module: [`Forge`] is the block-spanning `sdk::Module` over
//! the on-disk git substrate — the daemon, sim, and demo lanes compose it, and
//! the wasm tenant's host-side substrate (`forge_odb::ForgeOdbBacking`)
//! wraps it for the substrate half (root, browse/diff reads, snapshot packing,
//! materialization). the accept/reject logic is NOT here: `execute` delegates
//! to the shared [`ForgeState`] core, so this file owns only what touches disk
//! or reads a node-local object database.
//!
//! ## the host-lent staging seam (per repo + tracker)
//!
//! `execute` stages every change WITHOUT moving refs or the committed tracker
//! (`root()` reads committed state only); `commit_block` publishes staged
//! branches (or records node-local materialization targets) and swaps the
//! staged tracker in (persisting `<base>/.tracker.bin`); `abort_block` drops
//! everything staged.
