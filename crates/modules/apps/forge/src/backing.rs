//! the host-side git substrate a wasm forge tenant delegates its committed
//! surface to: [`ForgeOdbBacking`] implements [`wasm_host::OdbBacking`] over
//! the SAME native [`Forge`] the daemon lanes run. it is native forge with the
//! `sdk::Module` trait peeled off: the guest owns `execute` (the pure
//! [`ForgeState`](crate::state::ForgeState) core), the host owns everything
//! that touches a git object database — `root`, the browse/diff reads,
//! snapshot packing + install, materialization — and the block boundary is
//! driven by the kernel through the backing hooks.
//!
//! ## the block boundary, as the kernel drives it
//!
//! the guest chains the block's state image through the kernel's `__state`
//! lane and hands every packed head it stages to the object plane as a
//! [`RefTarget`] record (kind [`REF_TARGET_KIND`]). at commit the kernel:
//!
//! * flushes those records here via [`HostOdb::stage_put`] — buffered, no
//!   disk touch;
//! * calls [`OdbBacking::publish_block`] — a no-op: forge has no objects of
//!   its own to make durable (packs arrive out of band through the blob
//!   plane; the pending file is the durable record and lands at adopt);
//! * calls [`OdbBacking::adopt_refs`] with the block's final image — the
//!   substrate rebuilds the per-branch fates the guest staged (targets are
//!   the packed publications, dropped committed branches are deletes) and
//!   runs the native publish: the ref cache moves where the pack is present,
//!   the catch-up map records where it is not, the tracker swaps in, and
//!   both files persist — exactly `Forge::commit_block`.
//!
//! an aborted block drops the buffered targets ([`OdbBacking::discard_block`])
//! and the kernel drops the staged image, so nothing here moved.
