//! the tracker's public wire surface — issue / pull-request / review types.
//!
//! forge's tracker is GitHub-shaped: issues and PRs share ONE per-repo number
//! space (so `#42` is unambiguous), a PR's source is a real branch in the SAME
//! repo (no forks), and a review is the batched GitHub flow — one verdict, an
//! optional body, and zero or more line-anchored diff comments submitted
//! together. every item owns a hidden chat channel (`forge:<repo>:<number>`)
//! that carries its free-form discussion; the item's BODY lives HERE, on the
//! record, so authorship stays origin-derived (a chat follow-up would be
//! attributed to the forge module, not the opening user).
//!
//! authorship reuses chat's [`AuthorRef`] so the app renders forge authors
//! through the exact same display-name path as chat messages.
