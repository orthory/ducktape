//! STORAGE SUBSTRATE — DECIDED DIRECTION (2026-07-01)
//!   git2-rs (vendored libgit2) + sha1;  root() = sha256 over per-repo refs
//! ============================================================================
//!
//! forge stores its state in real git repos via libgit2 (the `git2-rs` crate,
//! VENDORED — so the node binary is SELF-CONTAINED, no `git` install needed), in
//! git's DEFAULT sha1 object format. the reasoning, because it is a non-obvious
//! stack of trade-offs:
//!
//! WHY libgit2 (git2-rs, vendored) instead of shelling out to `git`:
//!   DEPLOYABILITY. shelling out makes every validator depend on a compatible
//!   `git` binary on the host (and sha256-mode needs git >= ~2.42). vendoring
//!   libgit2 INTO the node binary makes it SELF-CONTAINED — no `git` install.
//!
//! WHY sha1 (git's default), NOT sha256, even though sha256 is "stronger":
//!   ECOSYSTEM COMPATIBILITY. forge is a *git* feature — users expect to clone it
//!   with a stock `git`, push/pull, import existing repos, and mirror to hosting.
//!   but a sha256 repo can do NONE of that with the outside git world:
//!     - git's sha1<->sha256 interop layer was designed years ago and NEVER
//!       shipped, so a sha256 repo cannot exchange objects with ANY sha1 repo
//!       (no importing an existing repo, no pushing to a sha1 remote);
//!     - hosting (GitHub/GitLab/...) largely REJECTS sha256 repos (no mirroring);
//!     - libgit2's sha256 is still behind an EXPERIMENTAL build flag, API in flux,
//!       not battle-tested in any forge.
//!   sha1 keeps forge a normal, interoperable git repo. the hash weakness is
//!   bounded: modern git/libgit2 use collision-DETECTING sha1 (SHA-1DC), and git
//!   itself ran on sha1 for ~18 years.
//!
//! WHY root() rehashes the oids under sha256, not the oids verbatim:
//!   a [`StateRoot`](sdk::StateRoot) is 32 bytes; a sha1 oid is only 20.
//!   rehashing the 20-byte branch oids under sha256 makes forge's contribution
//!   to the global root-hash sha256-STRENGTH. the only residual sha1 surface is
//!   a *forge-object* collision (two trees under one commit oid) — expensive and
//!   SHA-1DC-guarded — while the root-hash's collision resistance at the STATE
//!   layer stays sha256. (no committed branch and no tracker item anywhere ->
//!   StateRoot::ZERO.)
//!
//! WHAT DOES NOT CHANGE:
//!   - DETERMINISM: clients build immutable Git objects before submission;
//!     consensus only compare-and-swaps already-fixed oids and never reads a
//!     validator's node-local object database.
//!   - the object format is a NETWORK-WIDE GENESIS CONSTANT: every validator MUST
//!     use the identical format. a sha1 node and a sha256 node compute different
//!     roots for the same state and FORK. it is NOT a per-node choice.
//!
//! ============================================================================
//!
//! forge — a GIT-backed feature module: a NAMED NAMESPACE of multi-branch repos
//! plus a GitHub-shaped issue/PR TRACKER (see [`tracker`]).
//!
//! ## the load-bearing composition invariant
//!
//! forge's authenticated state root is a CANONICAL SORTED HASH over every born
//! branch of every repo, folded with the tracker's canonical bytes and
//! domain-separated under `FORGE_ROOT_DOMAIN`:
//!
//! ```text
//! root = sha256( FORGE_ROOT_DOMAIN ++ sha256(
//!                 for each repo sorted-by-name with >=1 born branch:
//!                     u32-LE(name.len) ++ name ++ u32-LE(ref_count) ++
//!                     for each (branch, head) sorted-by-branch:
//!                         u32-LE(branch.len) ++ branch ++ head.oid[20]
//!                 ++ if tracker non-empty:
//!                     TRACKER_DOMAIN ++ sha256(tracker.canonical_bytes()) ) )
//! ```
//!
//! with `root() == StateRoot::ZERO` on the empty state (the empty-genesis root).
//! this is a PURE FUNCTION of the committed consensus state — sorted, order-
//! independent, identical on every validator REGARDLESS of pack possession.
//! a branch head advances on every validator the instant its push CASes; the
//! objects catch up node-locally (see [`refs::RepoState::materialize`]) and
//! NEVER enter root/accept-reject. `main` and the shared `dev` integration
//! branch are protected (never deleted, fast-forward-guarded at materialize);
//! feature branches may force-push and be deleted — the GitHub flow.
//!
//! ## repo ownership — the ONLY protected-branch lever there is
//!
//! consensus CANNOT check ref descendancy: a validator may not hold the
//! objects, and reading them would break the determinism invariant above. so
//! AUTHORIZATION is the whole of protected-branch safety. the push that BIRTHS
//! a repo pins its owner — the Identity ACCOUNT id the origin resolves to (see
//! [`state::ForgeState::principal_of_origin`]; `git push` signs with the NODE
//! key, the app's merge with the USER key, and both collapse onto one account)
//! — and only that owner may move `main`/`dev` afterwards, whether by
//! [`ForgeMsg::PushRefs`] or by [`ForgeMsg::MergePr`] onto a protected target.
//! FEATURE branches stay open to every member.
//!
//! without the gate one signed op from any member CAS-moves `main` to bytes no
//! pack closes: `materialize` then refuses forever and `snapshot()` errors on
//! every node, so the network stops checkpointing and cannot admit joiners.
//!
//! ## the default repo
//!
//! every [`ForgeMsg`] carries a required `repo` field; an empty slug maps to
//! the well-known `"default"` repo. the unit [`ForgeQuery::Head`] answers the
//! default repo's `main` head.
//!
//! ## the consensus / data-plane boundary
//!
//! Git commit/tree/blob objects are data-plane state. a producer builds them
//! off-chain and the relay distributes their content-addressed pack before the
//! corresponding [`ForgeMsg::PushRefs`] enters consensus. consensus state owns
//! only the canonical branch oids (plus tracker state), and its sole Git write
//! is a pure `prev -> new` CAS.
//!
//! ## the two runtimes over one core
//!
//! the consensus half — the CAS gate, ownership, the tracker — is the pure
//! [`state::ForgeState`], and it is the ONLY implementation of forge's
//! accept/reject logic. two runtimes drive it:
//!
//! * the `native` [`Forge`] module (the daemon, sim, and demo lanes): one
//!   block-spanning struct over the on-disk git substrate — `execute` stages
//!   into the core, `commit_block` publishes staged branches (or records
//!   node-local materialization targets) and swaps the staged tracker in
//!   (persisting `<base>/.tracker.bin`), `abort_block` drops everything staged.
//! * the wasm `guest` (the production node): the core runs inside the
//!   component, re-entering each block through the host state lane, while a
//!   native [`ForgeOdbBacking`] on the host keeps the git substrate — the root,
//!   the browse/diff reads, snapshot packing, and materialization at the block
//!   boundary. the root is byte-identical across the two, so the cutover moves
//!   no committed state.

// the wire surface: this module's shared types, flattened at the crate root.
