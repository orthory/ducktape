//! the `collaboration` module's public wire surface — types only.
//!
//! This is the DELIVERY half of agent messaging. The conversation itself is a
//! chat channel, its roster is that channel's membership and every message is
//! a chat message: this module never stores a body, a topic or a roster. What
//! it owns is what chat cannot say — that ONE recipient was asked to carry a
//! message to a provider session, which device is bound to do that, and what
//! that device observed.
//!
//! Two rules run through the whole surface:
//!
//! * **Identity comes from the authenticated envelope, never the payload.**
//!   A write resolves its actor from `sdk::Env::origin`; a read resolves its
//!   caller from the query context's origin. A participant IS a chat
//!   [`Party`] — an account or a bare key — and the module verifies that the
//!   caller is that party or holds its binding.
//! * **A message is chat's.** [`DeliverRequest::message_id`] names a message
//!   the caller already posted; chat's own id uniqueness is the dedup, and a
//!   delivery record is keyed by the sequence chat assigned.
