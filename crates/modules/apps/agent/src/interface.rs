//! the agent module's public wire surface — types only.
//!
//! a PROGRAM ACCOUNT is a keyless account identity founds for a controller
//! account and this module executes ([`identity::Control::Program`]). a
//! BINDING ties one program account to one [`Program`]; its REVISION counts
//! the programs the account has been bound to. the account's AUTHORITY is
//! identity's control record — executor, standing, generation — read at every
//! start and every resumption and never copied: a transfer, a standing change
//! or a revocation acts the moment identity records it. an INVOCATION is one
//! program's handling of one attribution change delivered to its account: it
//! is keyed by the account and the change's plane-wide `seq`, runs under the
//! revision and generation it started at, advances step by step, holds at
//! most one outstanding request, and resumes when that request's outcome is
//! delivered back as data — or ends [`Status::Aborted`] when that authority
//! moved while it waited.
//!
//! ## programs
//!
//! a program is a finite list of [`Step`]s, data on the wire, never text. a
//! step is evaluated against the invocation's FRAME: the triggering change,
//! the causal context it was delivered under, the account itself, and every
//! name an earlier step bound. control only ever moves FORWARD — a branch or a
//! failure continuation names a later step (or the end) — so one invocation
//! visits each step at most once and evaluation is bounded by the program the
//! controller submitted. a persistent cycle is expressed the way the network
//! expresses everything: as a call whose effects attribute the account again,
//! each reaction being its own invocation that the program's predicates may
//! end.
//!
//! ## values and references
//!
//! a [`Value`] is a JSON template. rendering it produces the target's real
//! `sdk::wire` JSON — a [`Value::Ref`] splices a frame value in as a JSON
//! value, never as substituted text or bytes. replies, outputs and stamps are
//! decoded back into JSON explicitly ([`Decode`]); a non-integer number
//! anywhere is refused, so no evaluation ever depends on floating point.
//!
//! ## failure
//!
//! the program owns failure. a call that did not apply binds its
//! [`CallResult`] and continues at the step's failure continuation, which may
//! inspect the reason, recover with another call, [`Step::Report`] to a
//! recipient it chooses, or finish; with [`Continuation::Unhandled`] the
//! invocation ends [`Status::Failed`] with the outcome recorded. a fault of
//! the program itself (an unresolvable reference, an undecodable reply, a
//! frame the store cannot hold) is a [`ProgramFault`] recorded the same way.
//! nothing here undoes an earlier successful call or the change that invoked
//! the program: every invocation state is queryable and none is retried.
