//! the programmable-user module: program accounts, their bindings, and the
//! invocations that run their programs in consensus.
//!
//! ## what this module is
//!
//! a PROGRAM ACCOUNT is a keyless account identity founds on a controller's
//! behalf with this module as its EXECUTOR. it acts only through calls this
//! module queues at dispatch, which the host runs as `Origin::Program(account)`
//! after checking the account's current control record — never through a key,
//! never through a privilege this module holds. this module holds the
//! account's BINDING (its [`Program`], at a revision this module counts) and
//! every INVOCATION of it: one per attribution change delivered to the
//! account, keyed `(account, change.seq)`.
//!
//! ## every input is authenticated by its origin
//!
//! - identity's `ProgramCreated` reaches this module as `Origin::Module(identity)`
//!   in the same unit as the `CreateProgram` this module emitted; the binding
//!   is made only when a pending request with that number exists, names the
//!   same controller, and identity's own record of the account says it is a
//!   fresh, active program executed by this module.
//! - an attribution change reaches this module as `Origin::Module(attribution)`
//!   through the host's delivery lane, under a cause whose hop IS that
//!   delivery. a change emitted any other way is refused: a reaction runs in
//!   its own unit, never inside the source write's.
//! - a call completion or a dispatch result reaches this module as
//!   `Origin::Module(dispatch)` under the host's completion or delivery hop,
//!   and resumes only the invocation that queued exactly that request and is
//!   still waiting on it — when its authority still stands. otherwise it
//!   ends that invocation aborted, with what it found.
//! - a provision, replace or unbind is submitted by an account: a key-held one
//!   by signed frame, a program one through a call its executor queued. the
//!   acting account is resolved through identity at execution; the current
//!   controller identity records is the authority, never a copy held here.
//!
//! ## the shape of every handler
//!
//! validate the wire, LOAD every record the decision reads, DECIDE the whole
//! write set as a pure function (every value encoded and checked against the
//! store's value bound, every counter advanced with checked arithmetic), then
//! STAGE the plan and EMIT the follow-ups it named. nothing is staged before
//! the whole decision is known; a handler that errors leaves no partial
//! write. deciders read siblings only through [`program::Reads`].
//!
//! ## revision and authority
//!
//! two counters, two owners. the binding's REVISION is this module's: 0 at
//! provisioning, one more at every replacement. the account's control
//! GENERATION is identity's, advanced by every mutation of the control
//! record — a transfer, a standing change, and this module's own standing
//! re-set at a replace or unbind. an invocation records both as it starts
//! and runs only under them: every start and every resumption reads
//! identity's current record and requires an active program of this module
//! at that generation, bound at that revision. an answer that finds
//! otherwise ends the invocation aborted with what it found, and no step of
//! the program runs on it — nothing is reported, queued or dispatched under
//! an authority the invocation never had. a fresh change to an account whose
//! authority moved invokes its unchanged program under the current record:
//! a transferred program needs no replacement to keep running.
//!
//! ## state model
//!
//! pure logic over a host-injected [`sdk::MerkleStore`], every read a point
//! read through the block's staging overlay:
//!
//! - `bind{SEP}{account}` → the binding (borsh [`BindingRecord`]).
//! - `inv{SEP}{account}{SEP}{seq}` → one invocation (borsh [`InvocationRecord`]):
//!   its revision and generation, delivery item and cause, its bound facts
//!   verbatim, and its progress.
//! - `invn{SEP}{account}` → the account's invocation count, and
//!   `invn{SEP}{account}{SEP}{n}` → the `seq` of its n-th invocation (n from 1).
//! - `call{SEP}{invocation}` and `disp{SEP}{dispatch_id}` → the `(account, seq)`
//!   a queued call or dispatch belongs to.
//! - `preq{SEP}{request}` → a provision awaiting identity's answer, and
//!   `last_request` → the last request number handed out.
//!
//! writes are staged during a block and flushed in one batch at
//! `commit_block`; the module root IS the store's merkle root, and sync
//! belongs to the store.

// the wire surface: this module's shared types, flattened at the crate root.
