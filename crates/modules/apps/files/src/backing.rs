//! the host-side ODB substrate a wasm files tenant delegates its committed
//! surface to: [`FilesOdbBacking`] implements [`wasm_host::OdbBacking`] over the
//! SAME `duckfs_core::Fs<DiskStore>` + `DiskRefs` machinery the native
//! [`Files`](crate::module::Files) module runs on. it is native files with the
//! `sdk::Module` trait peeled off: the guest owns `execute`, the host owns the
//! committed surface (`root`/`query`/`snapshot`/`install`/`serve_sync` + the
//! object plane), and the block boundary is driven by the kernel through the two
//! backing hooks in the duckfs durability order.
//!
//! ## why this is not a fork of [`Files`]
//!
//! the crash-safety ordering is the load-bearing part, and it is SINGLE-SOURCED:
//! both this backing and [`Files::commit_block`](crate::module) call the same
//! [`persist_objects`] (objects → sync) and [`commit_refs`] (refs save → adopt →
//! gc) from [`crate::module`]. the only thing this file adds is the SHAPE the
//! kernel drives — the native module owns one block-spanning `pending` and
//! flushes it in one `commit_block`, whereas the kernel accumulates the block's
//! staged objects itself and hands them back one `stage_put` at a time, then
//! splits the flush (`publish_block`) from the refs adopt (`adopt_refs`). the
//! bytes on disk, and the root, are identical either way.
//!
//! ## the block boundary, as the kernel drives it
//!
//! * [`HostOdb::stage_put`] buffers one object in memory (native puts them in its
//!   `pending`); the object is NOT written to disk yet.
//! * [`OdbBacking::publish_block`] writes every buffered object and fsyncs the
//!   odb dirs ([`persist_objects`]) — the objects-durable barrier — and records
//!   the committing block's height (the kernel captured it during `execute`).
//! * [`OdbBacking::adopt_refs`] saves the refs envelope stamped with that height
//!   and adopts the new refs ([`commit_refs`]) — the sole place the root moves.
//! * [`OdbBacking::discard_block`] drops the in-memory buffer (native
//!   `Fs::abort_block`); nothing was written to disk, so there is nothing to
//!   sweep.
