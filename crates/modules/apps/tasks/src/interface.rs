//! the `tasks` module's public wire surface -- types only.
//!
//! this module hosts TWO boards behind one consensus module id:
//!
//! * the **task board** (assigned-list kind): ordered human task lists. writes
//!   go via [`TaskMsg`]; reads via [`TaskQuery`] -> [`TaskReply`]. no claims;
//!   [`Task::owner`] is origin-derived attribution and the per-owner census
//!   key, the same convention the job board uses for `submitter`/`worker`.
//!   any member's `UpdateStatus` and `DeleteTask` land on any task.
//! * the **job board** (first-claim kind): a consensus-native work board. a
//!   submitter posts a job, any worker claims it, exactly one claim wins by
//!   consensus order, the claimant processes off-platform and reports a result.
//!   writes go via [`JobsMsg`]; reads via [`JobsQuery`] -> [`JobsReply`].
//!   identities (`Job::submitter`, `Claim::worker`) are ALWAYS derived by the
//!   module from the dispatch origin, never carried on the wire.
//!
//! both boards ride ONE wire envelope, [`WorkMsg`]/[`WorkQuery`]/[`WorkReply`],
//! so the single module `execute`/`query` routes an op to its board. the
//! board-prefixed `encode_task_*`/`encode_job_*` helpers wrap a board message
//! in that envelope, so a caller keeps building `TaskMsg`/`JobsMsg` values.
