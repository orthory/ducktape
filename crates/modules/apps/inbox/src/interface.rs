//! the inbox module's public wire surface — types only.
//!
//! an inbox is an identity ACCOUNT's notification queue ([`AccountNumber`]):
//! the human behind an account reads one inbox however many keys the account
//! holds. its items are receipts of the attribution plane's canonical
//! changes — a [`Notification`] carries the change's [`ChangeRef`] (the
//! canonical seq, source, recipient, reason, kind, actor, cause and height)
//! and nothing the attribution record does not hold: the inbox is a VIEW of
//! central attribution, never a parallel route, and a change's detail stays
//! on the canonical record.
//!
//! ## two inputs, told apart by the authenticated origin
//!
//! - a DELIVERY: the attribution module's own delivery of one
//!   [`attribution::AttributionEvent::Changed`], run by the host under
//!   `Origin::Module(attribution)`. only that origin's payload decodes as a
//!   delivery; nothing else can mint a notification.
//! - an ADMIN op ([`InboxMsg`]): `MarkRead` and `Clear`, submitted by a key
//!   that identity resolves to the named account. programs, revoked
//!   accounts, unbound keys, modules and the system hold no human inbox and
//!   are refused.
//!
//! the read surface (paged lists, unread counts) lives on the derived tier
//! (`src/index.rs`), not here — the module serves no queries.
