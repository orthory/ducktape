//! a page is a TREE of [`Block`]s (notion's model, simplified): a `Page` block
//! starts a document, every block carries an ordered `children` list, and every
//! block id is GLOBALLY UNIQUE within the module — not merely unique inside its
//! page. that global uniqueness is the addressability contract: a block is
//! resolvable by id alone ([`PageQuery::GetBlock`] takes no page context), so a
//! reference to a block can be held by anything that can later ask the pages
//! module about it. a consumer that writes pages depends on THIS crate, never
//! on the pages impl.
