//! runs' read model: the run journal — every lifecycle fact the module
//! committed about a run, in commit order, and the run's current state as
//! the fold of them — folded from the applied-op feed into runs' per-module
//! index database.
//!
//! canonical runs state keeps only what consensus needs: the in-flight
//! correlation entries, the live sessions, and a short delivered-runs ring.
//! the lifecycle itself — who dispatched a run, which node picked it up,
//! what it did, how it ended — is what an operator watches, and it lives
//! here, where the engine iterates natively and nothing is pruned.
//!
//! the feed carries the facts as the module's own assigned stamp
//! ([`crate::RunEvent`], [`crate::decode_assigned`]): an op that moved a run
//! stamps the exact transitions it committed, so the fold never re-derives a
//! transition from a payload. an op with an empty stamp moved no run.
//!
//! key spaces (inside runs' per-module index database):
//! - `run/{dispatch_id}` — one [`RunView`] per run, its current state.
//! - `journal/{dispatch_id}/{height:016x}/{seq:08x}/{n:04x}` — one
//!   [`JournalRow`] per fact, in commit order: the op's position in the
//!   chain, then the fact's position within the op.
//! - `recent/{!height:016x}/{!seq:08x}/{!n:04x}` — the dispatch id of every
//!   run, newest dispatch first (the counters are bitwise inverted so an
//!   ascending scan reads newest-first).
//! - `agent/{agent_id}/{!height:016x}/{!seq:08x}/{!n:04x}` — the same, per
//!   agent.
//!
//! the dispatch id (hex sha256 of the run id, [`crate::dispatch_id_for`]) is
//! the key segment because a run id carries the run separator and
//! caller-chosen text; the digest is fixed-width and separator-free.
//!
//! this file is the DECISION core — pure functions over [`StateRead`],
//! compiled natively and unit-tested against a plain map. the wasm shell
//! (`src/index_guest.rs`, feature `index-guest`) wires it into the engine.
