//! the saga ledger — the DETERMINISTIC half of the async engine.
//!
//! a pure state-machine module (in the root-hash) that records async work in
//! flight: one effect, one agreed result, domain-agnostic. it is QMDB-BACKED:
//! pure logic over a host-injected [`sdk::MerkleStore`] with the shared
//! [`StagedStore`] overlay in front of it, so `root()` is the store's cached
//! merkle root, an op touches only the keys it names, and state-sync rides the
//! store's resolver lane instead of a byte snapshot whose size grew with every
//! saga ever triggered. it implements three of the platform's
//! ordering-contract promises
//! (docs/records/architecture/agent-collaboration-design.md §2, §4):
//!
//! - **P5 — result singularity.** exactly one `OracleResult` transitions a
//!   given attempt: the `(saga_id, attempt)` pair is the idempotency key, so
//!   duplicate results, results for terminal sagas, and stale-attempt results
//!   are all deterministic no-ops. an `Err` outcome consumes the attempt and
//!   re-leases while attempts remain; the last one lands `Failed`.
//! - **P6 — callback adjacency.** EVERY terminal transition (`Done`,
//!   `Failed`, `TimedOut`, `Cancelled`) with a `reply_to` emits a
//!   `SagaCallback` msg to the requester, which the host drains as a
//!   follow-up in the SAME block — the requester learns the outcome in the
//!   block the result lands, atomically with it.
//! - **P7 — deterministic deadlines.** expiry is never node-local: a
//!   permissionless `Crank` op sweeps pending sagas in id order (bounded by
//!   [`CRANK_BUDGET`]) and fires past-deadline timeouts and expired leases
//!   against the agreed `consensus_time` (a view number). given the same op
//!   sequence, every validator times out identically; liveness comes from
//!   anyone cranking, safety never depends on who does.
//!
//! ## the callback-poison rule (design §4)
//!
//! the terminal transition and the requester callback commit in one block; a
//! callback that ERRORS aborts that finalized block, which replays as a
//! deterministic no-op — wedging the saga at `Pending` forever. two defenses:
//! `reply_to` is validated against `ctx.module_root` at trigger time (an
//! unknown or self-targeting callback is rejected before a saga exists), and
//! requester callback arms MUST be no-fail by construction — treat a decode
//! failure as a staged no-op plus an event, never an `Err`.
//!
//! ## leases
//!
//! [`SagaModule::new`] runs [`LeasePolicy::Open`]: no assignee, any
//! submitter's result accepted (first agreed one wins), lease windows still
//! tracked when the trigger asks (so `Crank` can retry a silent worker).
//! [`SagaModule::with_assignment`] additionally rendezvous-assigns each
//! attempt to `pool[H(saga_id ‖ attempt ‖ height) % n]` over the valset
//! module's membership, with a capability registry on the side: a trigger
//! that names a capability then draws its pool from that tag's
//! ANNOUNCED PROVIDERS instead — only nodes that can execute the work ever
//! hold its lease, and a tag nobody provides assigns nobody (never the raw
//! valset). under [`LeasePolicy::Strict`] a result is accepted only from the
//! assignee's external origin. when the pool is empty or unavailable the
//! assignee is `None` and the emitted [`WorkerRequest`] is an ANNOUNCEMENT:
//! no result can land for it under strict — a capable node claims it with
//! `Accept` (first in consensus order wins the lease, and the re-emitted
//! request names the winner), so N capable nodes never each pay for the
//! same execution.
//!
//! ## the key space
//!
//! | logical key | value |
//! |---|---|
//! | `saga\0{id}` | one [`Saga`] record (borsh) — every field EXCEPT the spec bytes |
//! | `spec\0{id}{n:u64-le}` | chunk `n` of that saga's spec, raw bytes |
//! | `pending{shard:u8}` | one of [`PENDING_SHARDS`] LIVE id shards: a borsh `BTreeSet<String>` of non-terminal ids that hash to it |
//! | `terminal` | the terminal receipt index: a borsh `BTreeMap<String, TerminalEntry>` |
//!
//! ### why the spec is chunked
//!
//! a saga carries its `spec` up to [`MAX_SPEC_BYTES`] (12 MiB) and the store's
//! codec bounds ONE value at 1 MiB AT DECODE TIME
//! (`statesync::qmdb::store_config`), so one saga cannot be one record: an
//! oversized value would COMMIT fine and then panic every later read on every
//! validator. the spec is therefore split into [`SPEC_CHUNK_BYTES`] chunks
//! written ONCE at trigger and deleted with the saga, and the hot record —
//! status, attempt, lease, timestamps, origin — stays small enough that the
//! `Crank` sweep and the pending projections never touch a spec byte they do
//! not emit. the remaining large fields are already bounded well under the
//! record cap by the wire caps that gate them ([`MAX_REPLY_PAYLOAD_BYTES`] 64
//! KiB + [`MAX_RESULT_BYTES`] 256 KiB + [`MAX_ERROR_BYTES`] 16 KiB), so they
//! ride the hot record.
//!
//! ### why there are two id indexes
//!
//! the store hashes its keys and CANNOT enumerate, but four surfaces are
//! whole-map reads: `Crank`, `NextExpiry`, `AssignedPending` and
//! `UnassignedPending` all iterate the live sagas in id order, and the
//! retention trim ranks every TERMINAL saga. so the two domains are split
//! into two sentinel key spaces. the live one is SHARDED by `sha256(id)` over
//! [`PENDING_SHARDS`] records, so one saga's write touches exactly one of them
//! and the readers merge them back into a single sorted sequence. the terminal
//! one stays small by the trim itself: it is bounded by
//! [`MAX_RETAINED_TERMINAL`] plus one block's arrivals, and each entry carries
//! the `(updated_at, bytes)` the ranking needs so the trim never reads a saga
//! record it does not evict.
//!
//! ## GC
//!
//! retention is BOUNDED, and owners may still prune eagerly. `Prune` removes
//! terminal sagas on demand, gated to the recorded trigger origin per id; on
//! top of that EVERY op trims the terminal tail to [`MAX_RETAINED_TERMINAL`]
//! entries / [`MAX_RETAINED_TERMINAL_BYTES`] bytes, newest first
//! ([`terminal_evictions`]) — a pure function of the terminal index, so every
//! validator drops the identical set whether it replayed the state or synced
//! the store. pending sagas are never eligible: they are not in that index at
//! all. an evicted id behaves exactly like an explicitly pruned one: unknown
//! to every handler, and free to trigger again as new work.
//!
//! the trim runs inside `execute` and STAGES its removals, deliberately: the
//! native module merges its overlay at `commit_block` while the wasm shell
//! (`store_guest!`) calls the inner `commit_block` once per OP, so a boundary
//! hook reading the whole committed map would evict at a different point under
//! the two. both are chain participants — `bin/noded` and `bin/simnode`
//! construct this native module, `bin/node` loads the component — so they must
//! agree op for op, not just block for block.

// the wire surface: this module's shared types, flattened at the crate root.
