//! the saga module's public wire surface — types only.
//!
//! Saga is the deterministic async-RPC ledger: one effect, one agreed
//! result, with attempts, leases, deadlines, and a requester callback. six op
//! shapes cross this surface, all as [`SagaMsg`]:
//!
//! - `Trigger` STARTS a saga. the module records a pending saga and emits a
//!   [`WorkerRequest`] effect asking the host-owned worker to run the async
//!   work. a duplicate `saga_id` is a deterministic no-op.
//! - `OracleResult` COMPLETES an attempt — submitted by a host-owned worker as
//!   a NORMAL op (the oracle-as-transaction), so every validator applies the
//!   AGREED result through the same ordered path. the `(saga_id, attempt)`
//!   pair is the idempotency key: exactly one result transitions a given
//!   attempt; duplicates and stale attempts are deterministic no-ops.
//! - `Accept` CLAIMS an unassigned attempt: an UNASSIGNED [`WorkerRequest`]
//!   (empty/unavailable provider pool) is an ANNOUNCEMENT, not a work order —
//!   a capable node answers it with `Accept` under its own key, the first
//!   accept in consensus order becomes the assignee, and the saga re-emits
//!   the effect naming the winner. one execution, however many nodes could
//!   have run it.
//! - `Crank` is the permissionless liveness op: it deterministically fires
//!   past-deadline timeouts and expires stale leases (retry or fail). anyone
//!   may crank; safety never depends on who does.
//! - `Cancel` terminates a pending saga — gated to the trigger origin.
//! - `Prune` removes TERMINAL sagas on demand — gated to the trigger origin
//!   per id. it is the owner's EAGER GC on top of a bounded automatic trim:
//!   every op also drops the terminal tail past a fixed count/byte cap
//!   (newest kept first), so a terminal saga is never guaranteed to still be
//!   readable — treat the callback, not the ledger, as the durable result.
//!
//! every terminal transition with a `reply_to` emits a [`SagaCallback`] msg to
//! the requester in the SAME block — requesters depend only on this crate to
//! decode it. reads go via [`SagaQuery`] -> [`SagaReply`].
