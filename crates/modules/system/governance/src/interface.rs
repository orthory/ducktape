//! the governance module's public wire surface — types only.
//!
//! governance defaults to one ballot per validator node. the validators may
//! initialize non-transferable Identity-account shares, then governance can
//! switch future proposals between validator and account-share mode. every new
//! proposal freezes the electorate that decides it. passing
//! membership actions are performed by emitting the valset op as a host-drained
//! follow-up — governance remains the ONLY authorized author of valset changes.
//!
//! authorship is trusted because the ordered lane VERIFIES frame signatures:
//! `Origin::External(pubkey)` reaching a module is authenticated. validator
//! mode keys a ballot by that node key; share mode resolves the key to its one
//! Identity account (`OfKey`), so no key can forge another principal's ballot.
