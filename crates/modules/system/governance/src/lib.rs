//! qmdb-backed validator governance with optional account-share voting.
//!
//! the module that closes the private network's membership loop: a CURRENT
//! valset member proposes (`AddValidator` / `RemoveValidator` / `Signal`),
//! members vote before a consensus-time deadline, and anyone may trigger
//! `Execute` once the outcome is decidable. a passing membership action emits
//! the valset op as a host-drained follow-up in the SAME block — and the
//! valset module only accepts membership ops from THIS module's origin (its
//! wired `governance_id`, never a bare module origin), so governance is the
//! sole authorized author of membership change.
//!
//! ## why authorship is trustworthy
//!
//! the ordered lane verifies every frame's signature before the host sees it,
//! so `Origin::External(pubkey)` here is AUTHENTICATED. validator mode keys
//! ballots by that node key directly; share mode deterministically resolves
//! the origin key to its Identity account (`OfKey`), so no key can forge
//! another principal's vote. a node key is never an account: no node is bound
//! to one, and no account fans out to nodes.
//!
//! ## determinism
//!
//! governance defaults to validator-node ballots. `AdoptShares` initializes an
//! explicit Identity-account allocation; governance may then switch future
//! proposals between validator and account principals. every new proposal
//! freezes its electorate and rule, so later mode/membership/share changes
//! cannot move its decision boundary or count the same shares twice.
//!
//! ## State model
//!
//! pure logic over a host-injected [`sdk::MerkleStore`]: the HOST constructs
//! the concrete store (qmdb today — `statesync::qmdb::QmdbStore`) and hands it
//! to [`Governance::new`], so this crate never names a storage crate. one
//! logical record per proposal (`prop\0{id}`) and per settled invite
//! redemption (`red\0{nonce}`), plus three aggregate records:
//!
//! - the proposal ROSTER (the sorted OPEN-proposal-id list, bounded by
//!   [`MAX_PROPOSALS`] and, per submitter, by
//!   [`MAX_OPEN_PROPOSALS_PER_SUBMITTER`]) — the ONE enumeration read. an id
//!   leaves the roster the moment it settles: `Execute` evicts it when the
//!   tally passes or rejects it, and `Propose` opportunistically evicts any
//!   OTHER roster entry whose own voting deadline has passed with nobody
//!   having executed it (the only way an unexecuted proposal expires
//!   deterministically without a network-wide per-block tick). the proposal
//!   RECORD itself is kept forever under its own key — only the roster
//!   narrows — so a settled id's history is still a point read away. it
//!   stays canonical because governance's read model CANNOT move to the
//!   derived index tier: a proposal's frozen electorate, every ballot's
//!   principal resolution, and the settlement tally all read the
//!   valset/identity SIBLINGS at execute time, so an index fold over
//!   governance's own applied ops could only reproduce proposal state by
//!   re-implementing the consensus tally over other modules' state — a
//!   second consensus implementation, which is worse than a bounded
//!   canonical id list. the operator ceremonies (the CLI's
//!   adopt-an-open-proposal flow) consume this listing;
//! - the SHARE REGISTRY (bounded by [`MAX_SHARE_ACCOUNTS`]) — consensus
//!   consumes it whenever a proposal freezes an account electorate;
//! - the share-MODE flag — consensus consumes it on every `Propose`.
//!
//! redemptions have NO enumeration: the exactly-once gate and the node's
//! join-lobby pre-check (V6) are both point reads by nonce, so the set lives
//! as point records alone and grows without an aggregate to poison.
//!
//! writes are staged during a block and flushed to the store in one batch at
//! `commit_block`; the module root IS the store's merkle root. sync belongs
//! to the store, not this module: a joiner rebuilds the concrete store from a
//! peer (`QmdbStore::sync_from`) and wraps a fresh `Governance` around it.
//!
//! oversized values never reach the store (the poison-value lesson — the qmdb
//! wire codec bounds a value at decode, so an over-cap committed value would
//! wedge every syncing peer): a NEW proposal record is byte-gated at half of
//! [`MAX_PROPOSAL_RECORD_BYTES`] (accumulated ballots can at most double the
//! frozen-electorate section, so a settled record stays under the full cap),
//! the roster is byte-gated at [`MAX_ROSTER_RECORD_BYTES`] on top of its
//! id-length and count caps, and a redemption record is fixed-size by
//! construction (32-byte keys, 16-byte nonce).
//!
//! ## Genesis config (the invite binding)
//!
//! the per-network invite binding reaches the NATIVE module through
//! [`Governance::with_invite_binding`]. the wasm tenant is fixed bytes, so
//! there the binding rides GENESIS CONFIG: the host seeds the reserved
//! `__config` entry ([`sdk::genesis_config`]) into this module's store at
//! genesis construction — under [`sdk::store_key`], the same logical→store
//! mapping every record here uses — and the guest decodes it per dispatch.
//! the config is consensus state in the store's merkle root from genesis and
//! rides state-sync like any other record. this module never writes that key.

// the wire surface: this module's shared types, flattened at the crate root.
