//! the wasm port of this module, built the ADAPTER way: the NATIVE
//! `governance` crate is compiled to wasm32 unmodified and adapted to the
//! `ducktape:module` world through `guest-adapter`, so the module's logic is
//! single-sourced (a behavior change in the native crate IS the wasm change).
//! the packaging cdylib around this port is synthesized by `guest-builder` —
//! this module is the whole of the guest's hand-written surface.
//!
//! ## the STORE-BACKED dispatch model, and why it is equivalent
//!
//! governance is pure logic over a host-injected [`sdk::MerkleStore`] — so
//! the port injects [`WitStore`], the adapter's `MerkleStore` over the wit
//! `state-*` imports, and the REAL qmdb store stays host-side
//! (`WasmModule::with_store`). there is NO per-dispatch snapshot: the store
//! IS the state and the wasm root is the store's Merkle root. See the
//! `pages` guest port for the staging-contract argument spelled out point by
//! point — governance rides the identical seams:
//!
//! * the guest rebuilds the module FRESH per dispatch over the exact
//!   production builder chain (`Governance::new` with the valset/identity
//!   sibling ids below, plus the code registry); its inner `StagedStore`
//!   overlay is per-dispatch, and cross-dispatch read-your-writes comes from
//!   the host's outer staged overlay via `WitStore::get`
//!   (staged-over-committed) — every decision in the execute paths reads
//!   through it (the proposal roster and records, the redeemed-nonce set,
//!   the share registry and mode flag), so a propose-then-vote cascade
//!   inside one block decides byte-identically to native.
//! * each successful `execute` flushes the inner staging with the inner
//!   `commit_block` — `state-set`/`state-delete` OUTER staging the host
//!   publishes into the real store in ONE `commit_batch` at the true block
//!   boundary.
//! * governance exercises every seam the runtime offers at once: sibling
//!   reads (valset membership, identity account resolution) resolve through
//!   the memoized replay, and a passing proposal EMITS follow-up msgs
//!   (valset membership ops, lifecycle upgrade schedules + code swaps) that
//!   the runtime republishes through the host ctx only after a clean run —
//!   so a wasm governance still drives the code registry that live-updates
//!   the other wasm tenants.
//!
//! ## the genesis-config invite binding
//!
//! governance's per-network parameter is the INVITE BINDING — the genesis
//! namespace every invite token and join proof verify against. a wasm
//! component is fixed bytes, so the binding arrives as GENESIS CONFIG: the
//! host seeds an `sdk::genesis_config`-encoded `__config` record into this
//! module's qmdb store at genesis construction — under [`sdk::store_key`],
//! the store-backed twin of the host-KV `__config` entry — and every
//! dispatch reads it back through [`load_store_config`] and constructs the
//! native module with it. the config is consensus state in the store's
//! merkle root from genesis, and it rides state-sync like any other record.
//! the valset / lifecycle / identity sibling ids are genesis-constant wiring
//! (identical on every network), so they stay compiled in like every other
//! port's sibling ids.
