//! The `.duck` gateway: the whole **name → AccountId → route** pipeline as one
//! consensus module.
//!
//! An Identity account signs one monotonic route from its apex or a single
//! service label to a typed upstream target plus an invocation policy, AND —
//! as the handle plane absorbed from duckdns — an optional human `.duck` name
//! aliasing its stable AccountId. Resolution stops at the AccountId; this
//! module stores no node address, local port, browser session, content bytes,
//! or transport state. `.duck` is Ducktape presentation syntax, never installed
//! into the host DNS stack.
