//! the identity module's public wire surface -- types only.
//!
//! an ACCOUNT is an abstract principal identified by a NUMBER (monotonic from
//! 1). how it is CONTROLLED ([`Control`]) decides which ops apply to it:
//!
//! - a KEY-HELD account ([`Control::Keys`]) owns an ASSOCIATION of keys of
//!   mixed [`KeyScheme`]s (an ed25519 device key, an Ethereum wallet, a
//!   WebAuthn passkey) and acts by signed frames: the frame ORIGIN is the
//!   acting key. [`IdentityMsg::Create`] founds an account for the origin,
//!   [`IdentityMsg::AddKey`] admits the origin into an existing member's
//!   account (that member proves consent over [`add_key_preimage`] at the
//!   origin's CURRENT generation, naming the ACCOUNT it admits into and the
//!   consensus time it dies at, so the proof is single-use, account-bound and
//!   short-lived), and `RemoveKey`/`SetName`/`SetProfile` need nothing but the
//!   origin's membership.
//! - a PROGRAM account ([`Control::Program`]) holds no key, ever. it is
//!   provisioned by a module ([`IdentityMsg::CreateProgram`], module-origin
//!   only: the emitting module becomes its EXECUTOR) on behalf of a CONTROLLER
//!   account, and acts only through calls its executor queued, which the host
//!   runs as `Origin::Program(account)` after checking the account's current
//!   control record. its GENERATION counts the mutations of that record; a
//!   call queued under an older generation is refused at execution, which is
//!   how an executor ([`IdentityMsg::SetProgramStanding`]) or a controller
//!   ([`IdentityMsg::TransferControl`]) invalidates everything queued before.
//!   [`IdentityMsg::RevokeProgram`] freezes it for good.
//! - a REVOKED account ([`Control::Revoked`]) is a former program: it never
//!   acts again and its record never changes again.
//!
//! no account is ever keyed by a key, no node is ever bound to an account, and
//! an account number is never spelled where a key goes: attribution comes from
//! a user-signed origin resolved through [`IdentityQuery::OfKey`], or from the
//! host-authenticated `Origin::Program(account)`.
