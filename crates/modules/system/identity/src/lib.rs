//! qmdb-backed ACCOUNT registry: numbered principals, key-held or programmed.
//!
//! an ACCOUNT is identified by a NUMBER (monotonic from 1) and is CONTROLLED
//! one of three ways ([`Control`]): by an ASSOCIATION of keys of mixed
//! schemes (an ed25519 device key, an Ethereum wallet, a WebAuthn passkey --
//! see [`KeyScheme`]), by a PROGRAM a module executes on a controller's
//! behalf, or not at all any more (REVOKED). the control decides which ops
//! apply; nothing else about a record does.
//!
//! ## key-held accounts
//!
//! the frame ORIGIN is the acting key for every key op; a node key is never
//! bound to an account, and no consumer ever asks "whose node is this" --
//! attribution comes only from a user-signed origin, resolved through
//! [`IdentityQuery::OfKey`].
//!
//! - [`IdentityMsg::Create`] founds an account for the origin key.
//! - [`IdentityMsg::AddKey`] admits the origin key into an existing member's
//!   account: the member consents over [`add_key_preimage`] at the origin's
//!   CURRENT generation; acceptance advances that generation, so the consent
//!   is single-use -- including after a compromised key is removed. a removed
//!   key is never burned (a wallet or an SSH key cannot be re-minted): it can
//!   be re-admitted anywhere by a consent signed at its next generation. the
//!   consent also NAMES the account it admits into and the consensus time it
//!   dies at: an unspent one neither follows its author onto another account
//!   nor outlives [`MAX_CONSENT_TTL`]. there is no revoke op -- the clock is
//!   the revocation, and it is why the ceiling is days rather than months.
//! - [`IdentityMsg::RemoveKey`] drops a key: a member removes ITSELF or a key
//!   admitted no earlier than it was, never the last one. seniority is what
//!   stops a key admitted by a mis-issued consent from evicting the founders
//!   who predate it -- an account cannot be taken over from the bottom.
//! - [`IdentityMsg::SetName`] / [`IdentityMsg::SetProfile`] are gated by the
//!   ACTING ACCOUNT alone: a member key's account, or the program account the
//!   host runs (below).
//!
//! ## program accounts
//!
//! a program account holds no key, ever, and no key op names one: a key is
//! only ever admitted into a key-held account, and `Origin::Program` is
//! refused by every key op. it exists because a module asked for it:
//!
//! - [`IdentityMsg::CreateProgram`] is module-origin only. the emitting
//!   module becomes the EXECUTOR (a payload can never name one); the
//!   CONTROLLER it names must be live (key-held, or an active program). the
//!   account is founded at generation 0, active, and
//!   [`IdentityEvent::ProgramCreated`] goes back to the executor as a
//!   follow-up in the same unit -- so the executor's binding and the account
//!   commit together or not at all. the executor authenticates that
//!   follow-up by origin ([`authenticate_event`]).
//! - the host runs a program's call as `Origin::Program(account)` only after
//!   checking its CURRENT record: executor, generation and an active
//!   standing. the GENERATION counts the record's mutations -- a standing
//!   change ([`IdentityMsg::SetProgramStanding`], executor-origin only, also
//!   when the standing is unchanged) or a control transfer
//!   ([`IdentityMsg::TransferControl`], controller-origin only) -- so every
//!   call queued under an older generation is refused at execution. that is
//!   the whole invalidation mechanism: an executor unbinding or replacing a
//!   program, or a controller handing it on, never has to find what was
//!   queued. it is advanced with checked arithmetic before any write; an
//!   exhausted generation refuses the op whole.
//! - [`IdentityMsg::RevokeProgram`] (controller-origin only) freezes the
//!   account as [`Control::Revoked`]: no standing, no generation, no op ever
//!   touches it again, and it can never act or control.
//! - the control graph is a forest: a controller is never the account itself
//!   nor one it transitively controls, checked at provisioning and at every
//!   transfer, so a chain of controllers always ends at a key-held account.
//!
//! an `Origin::Program(account)` acts as that account for the ops a member key
//! would perform on its own account (rename, profile). the account number is
//! never spelled where a key goes, so nothing resolves a program through the
//! key index.
//!
//! ## State model
//!
//! pure logic over a host-injected [`sdk::MerkleStore`]: the HOST constructs
//! the concrete store (qmdb today -- `statesync::qmdb::QmdbStore`) and hands
//! it to [`Identity::new`], so this crate never names a storage crate. one
//! record per account (`acct\0{number}`, an `AccountRecord` whose control
//! is the sum type the wire [`Control`] views), the KEY INDEX
//! (`key\0{pubkey}` -> number), the per-key ADMISSION COUNTER (`gen\0{pubkey}`
//! -> how many times that key has been admitted anywhere; absent = 0), the
//! CONTROLLED SET (`ctl\0{controller}` -> the sorted numbers of every account
//! whose control record names that controller; absent = none), and `next`
//! (the next account number; absent = 1). no roster: accounts are never
//! deleted, so `All` walks `acct\0{from..next}` directly, and [`MAX_ACCOUNTS`]
//! caps `next`. the store hashes every key, so nothing here is a prefix scan:
//! `Controlled` pages the one set record.
//!
//! writes are staged during a block and flushed to the store in one batch at
//! `commit_block`; the module root IS the store's merkle root. sync belongs
//! to the store, not this module: a joiner rebuilds the concrete store from a
//! peer (`QmdbStore::sync_from`) and wraps a fresh `Identity` around it.
//!
//! oversized values never reach the store (the poison-value lesson -- the
//! qmdb wire codec bounds a value at decode, so an over-cap committed value
//! would wedge every syncing peer): EVERY path that grows an account record
//! restages the whole record through the [`MAX_ACCOUNT_RECORD_BYTES`] gate,
//! and a controlled set through the store's own [`sdk::MAX_STORE_VALUE_BYTES`].
//! every op encodes and checks all of its writes before it stages any, so a
//! refused op leaves nothing staged.
//!
//! ## Genesis config (the chain id)
//!
//! the per-network chain id reaches the NATIVE module through
//! [`Identity::new`]. the wasm tenant is fixed bytes, so there the id rides
//! GENESIS CONFIG: the host seeds the reserved `__config` entry
//! ([`sdk::genesis_config`]) into this module's store at genesis construction
//! -- under [`sdk::store_key`], the same logical→store mapping every record
//! here uses -- and the guest decodes it per dispatch. the config is
//! consensus state in the store's merkle root from genesis and rides
//! state-sync like any other record. this module never writes that key.
//!
// the wire surface: this module's shared types, flattened at the crate root.
