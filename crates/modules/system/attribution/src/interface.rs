//! the attribution plane's public wire surface — types only.
//!
//! an attribution relates a SOURCE OCCURRENCE (a module's object at one of
//! that module's revisions) to a RECIPIENT ACCOUNT for a REASON. the source
//! module owns the relation's validity: it reports the object's full relation
//! set at each revision, and this plane derives what changed, records the
//! change durably under a stable id, and keeps the current set queryable.
//!
//! ## identities
//!
//! - a RELATION is `(source, recipient, reason)`. `detail` is the relation's
//!   payload, not part of its identity.
//! - a CHANGE is one relation appearing, disappearing, or moving at one
//!   source revision: `(source, revision, recipient, reason, kind)`, and it
//!   carries a plane-wide sequence number that never repeats. a relation
//!   withdrawn at one revision and re-added at a later one is two changes.
//! - a SOURCE is the emitting module (the authenticated dispatch origin, never
//!   a payload field) plus the module's own object kind and object id.
//!
//! ## reasons
//!
//! [`Reason`] names the standard vocabulary as a convenience. it is not a
//! closed world and carries no cardinality: a source that has co-owners or
//! several assignees reports several relations with the same reason, and a
//! source with a reason of its own reports [`Reason::Defined`]. whether a
//! change is a TRANSFER is the source's statement too ([`Transfer`]), never
//! an inference from a reason name.
//!
//! ## recipients and actors
//!
//! a recipient is an [`identity::AccountNumber`] — the one stable identity a
//! human account with many keys and a keyless program account share. identity
//! numbers accounts from 1, so account 0 is the value no account holds and a
//! report naming it as an actor, a recipient or a transfer side is invalid.
//! the source resolves the authenticated actor and validates recipients
//! before it reports; this plane records what the authenticated source says.
//!
//! an [`Actor`] is the account behind the source write when the source could
//! resolve one (a member key through identity's key resolver, or the program
//! account the host ran), the bare authenticated key when it could not (a
//! signed origin that holds no account — a node's own key operating a channel
//! it owns), the module writing as itself, or the system. a source never
//! spells an unbound key as account 0, never attributes its own write to a
//! module, and never attaches a key to a program account.
//!
//! ## cause
//!
//! every change carries the [`sdk::Cause`] of the dispatch that recorded it —
//! read from the authenticated execution context, never from the report — so
//! a reader can tell which call or delivery a change descends from.
//!
//! ## delivery
//!
//! a SUBSCRIBER is a module that receives every change recorded after it
//! subscribed, one delivery per change, as an [`AttributionEvent::Changed`]
//! follow-up the host runs in its own unit. the genesis subscribers are the
//! plane's constructor wiring; a later one registers itself with the
//! module-origin [`AttributionMsg::Subscribe`]. every delivery has a
//! source-global item number (one numbering across every subscriber, never
//! reused), is queued when its change is recorded, and is retired exactly
//! once with the host's acknowledgment ([`sdk::Ack`]); its outcome stays
//! queryable as a [`Delivery`] receipt, by subscriber and by change. nothing
//! is suppressed on the way: the subscriber decides which recipients it
//! handles.
//!
//! ## identifiers and bounds
//!
//! an identifier a source chooses (an object kind, an object id, a defined
//! reason name, an actor module id) is non-empty and free of the reserved key
//! separator, so it can never alias another key. there is no other length
//! rule on the wire: a record's size is bounded where it is stored, by the
//! backing store's value bound ([`sdk::MAX_STORE_VALUE_BYTES`]), and a report
//! whose records would not fit is invalid.
