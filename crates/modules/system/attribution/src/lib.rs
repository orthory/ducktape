//! the attribution plane — the canonical record of which accounts relate to
//! which source objects, for which reasons, and of every change to that;
//! and the queue that hands every change to the modules subscribed to it.
//!
//! a source module owns its objects and the validity of their relations. at
//! each revision of an object it reports the object's FULL relation set
//! ([`AttributionMsg::Attribute`]) in the same block as the write that
//! produced it. this module diffs the report against the object's current set
//! and records one [`Change`] per relation that appeared, disappeared, or
//! (by the source's statement) moved. recording is the whole of the report's
//! effect; delivering a change is a separate fact, defined over
//! [`AttributionEvent`], queued here and run by the host between blocks.
//!
//! ## origin-keyed trust
//!
//! the source of a report is the authenticated dispatch origin — a module —
//! never a payload field. an external submitter and the system have no
//! surface here. the `actor` a report names is provenance the authenticated
//! source vouches for (it resolved the key that signed the source write to
//! its account, or kept the bare key when it holds none); it grants nothing.
//! the `cause` a change carries is the dispatch's own authenticated context,
//! never a payload field either.
//!
//! ## report semantics, stated once
//!
//! - a relation is identified by `(recipient, reason)` within its object.
//!   `detail` is payload: the latest report's detail replaces the stored one,
//!   and a report whose only difference is detail records no change.
//! - `revision` is the source's per-object revision. each report's revision
//!   must exceed the object's last recorded one; an equal or older revision
//!   is a conflict (a replayed or stale report) and rejects. an object's first
//!   report may carry any revision.
//! - the diff is deterministic: the relations withdrawn are those held before
//!   and absent now, the relations added are those absent before and held
//!   now, and changes are recorded in `(recipient, reason)` order.
//! - a [`Transfer`] is the source's statement that one relation moved between
//!   accounts. it must match a withdrawal of `(from, reason)` and an addition
//!   of `(to, reason)` in that same diff, which it relabels as
//!   [`ChangeKind::TransferredOut`] and [`ChangeKind::TransferredIn`]. no
//!   transfer is ever inferred: co-owners and co-assignees are just several
//!   relations with one reason.
//! - the empty set is a valid report: it withdraws every relation, which is
//!   how a deleted object reads.
//!
//! ## delivery semantics, stated once
//!
//! - a SUBSCRIBER is a module. the genesis set is constructor wiring
//!   ([`AttributionModule::with_subscribers`]); a module registers itself
//!   later with the module-origin [`AttributionMsg::Subscribe`]. the
//!   effective set is their union, sorted; an exact resubscription is a
//!   no-op.
//! - every change recorded while a module is subscribed is queued for it,
//!   once, at recording time — so a new subscriber receives the changes that
//!   follow its subscription and never the history before it, and nothing is
//!   ever rewound or repeated. no recipient, actor, reason or self-relation
//!   is suppressed: the subscriber decides what it handles.
//! - a queued delivery has a SOURCE-GLOBAL item number: one numbering across
//!   every subscriber, monotonic, never reused. the sibling deliveries of one
//!   change (one per subscriber) are distinct items that share one causal
//!   root: the root the recording dispatch already had, or — for a report
//!   recorded under a direct dispatch — the change itself
//!   ([`Root::Change`]).
//! - the host reads the queue head from COMMITTED state ([`Module::pending_items`]),
//!   runs each delivery at its subscriber as this module's follow-up, and
//!   retires the item with one acknowledgment ([`Module::acknowledge`]) in
//!   the delivery's own unit. items retire strictly in order; a retired
//!   delivery keeps the host's outcome — applied, failed with the
//!   subscriber's reason, or the fixed unrepresentable marker — as a
//!   queryable receipt, and never changes again. an exact duplicate
//!   acknowledgment is a no-op; one that names another target or outcome is
//!   refused.
//!
//! ## atomic with the source
//!
//! a report rides its source write's block. an invalid report — wrong origin,
//! undecodable bytes, malformed identifiers, account 0, an empty actor key, a
//! stale revision, a duplicate relation, an unmatched transfer, a record the
//! store could not hold, an exhausted numbering — is an ERROR, so the source
//! write and its attribution commit together or not at all. a source that
//! accepted a write it cannot attribute would leave the record silently
//! wrong; a loud failure is the producer's bug to fix.
//!
//! the arm keeps that atomic by shape: it validates the wire, LOADS every
//! record the decision reads, DECIDES the complete write set as a pure
//! function (staleness, diff, sequence and item allocation with checked
//! arithmetic, every value encoded and checked against the store's value
//! bound — a queued delivery against the size its fixed-marker retirement
//! will need, so an acknowledgment never finds the room missing), and only
//! then STAGES the plan through one writer that cannot fail. nothing is
//! staged before the whole report is known to be valid.
//!
//! ## state model
//!
//! pure logic over a host-injected [`sdk::MerkleStore`], every read a point
//! read through the block's staging overlay (the queue head read the host
//! makes between blocks is the one exception: committed state only):
//!
//! - `rel{SEP}{module}{SEP}{kind}{SEP}{object}` → the object's current
//!   revision, its relations sorted by `(recipient, reason)`, and its change
//!   count (borsh [`ObjectRecord`]).
//! - `chg{SEP}{seq}` → one [`Change`], under the plane-wide sequence number
//!   `last_seq` hands out and never reuses (absent = nothing recorded yet).
//! - `rcpt{SEP}{account}` → that recipient's change count, and
//!   `rcpt{SEP}{account}{SEP}{n}` → the `seq` of its n-th change (n from 1).
//! - `obj{SEP}{module}{SEP}{kind}{SEP}{object}{SEP}{n}` → the `seq` of the
//!   object's n-th change (n from 1); the count lives on the object record.
//! - `subs` → the registered subscribers, sorted (absent = none registered;
//!   the genesis set lives in the module's wiring, not the store).
//! - `queue` → the delivery queue's bounds: `head` (the first unretired
//!   item) and `next` (the next item number), both from 1.
//! - `item{SEP}{n}` → one [`DeliveryRecord`]: the subscriber, the change,
//!   the causal root, and whether it is queued or retired with which outcome.
//! - `sub{SEP}{module}` → that subscriber's delivery count, and
//!   `sub{SEP}{module}{SEP}{k}` → the item of its k-th delivery (k from 1).
//! - `dlv{SEP}{module}{SEP}{seq}` → the item delivering change `seq` to
//!   that subscriber.
//!
//! the dense numberings are the cursors the query surface pages over;
//! nothing enumerates keys, and the queue head read is bounded by the shared
//! per-block batch ([`sdk::MAX_DELIVERIES_PER_BLOCK`]). each numbering is a
//! `u64` that only ever grows by one per record, so exhausting one is a
//! rejection of the report that would need the next number, never a wrap.
//! writes are staged during a block and flushed in one batch at
//! `commit_block`; the module root IS the store's merkle root, and sync
//! belongs to the store.

// the wire surface: this module's shared types, flattened at the crate root.
