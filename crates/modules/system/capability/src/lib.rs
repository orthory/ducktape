//! the qmdb-backed network-wide registry of node host capabilities.
//!
//! a "capability" is an open-set string tag ("codex", "claude", ...) naming
//! something a node's HOST can execute for the network — the consensus-side
//! half of the provider seam: this module replicates *who provides what*;
//! actually spawning a provider is host code and never happens here (no I/O,
//! no provider-specific logic). every node holds an identical view at every
//! height, which is exactly the property work assignment needs (all nodes
//! must agree deterministically on who could serve a job).
//!
//! announcements are declarative, self-scoped, and truthful by construction:
//! [`CapabilityMsg::Announce`] replaces the SUBMITTER's full tag set — the
//! announced identity is the verified external submit origin, never payload
//! data, so a node can only speak for itself. an empty set removes the node.
//! when constructed with a valset id, announcements are additionally gated to
//! current validators UNION residents:
//! a joined-but-not-promoted node provides real executors too, and its
//! announce is what lets dispatch route work to it. without a valset (the
//! single-node daemon) any external key may self-announce. the gate is not
//! announce-time-only: [`Module::query_with`] re-checks standing on every
//! `Providers` / `CapableProviders` read, so a node that leaves, is revoked,
//! or drops out of the resident window stops being returned even though its
//! stale record is still in the roster — nothing needs to delete the record
//! for the node to stop being handed work. (liveness of a standing node —
//! whether it is actually up — is a separate concern this module does not
//! address.)
//!
//! an `Announce` may additionally carry `resources`: announced numeric
//! capacity per open-set dimension ("cores" -> 8, "mem_gb" -> 32), riding the
//! same declarative replace as tags. capacity with nothing to execute is
//! meaningless, so resources without at least one tag is rejected; a
//! tags-only node stays valid (capacity is optional — a claim is a claim)
//! but never satisfies a demands-carrying query — absent is never infinite.
//! [`CapabilityQuery::CapableProviders`] is the read work assignment filters
//! on: providers of a capability whose announced resources cover every
//! demanded dimension.
//!
//! ## capability classes
//!
//! the registry additionally routes capability CLASSES — namespace tokens
//! (`agent`, `ai`, ...) a MODULE claims via [`CapabilityMsg::ClaimClass`].
//! the wire form of a classed capability is `<class>:<rest>` and dispatch
//! addresses classed work as `<node_id>/<class>:<rest>` (see
//! [`parse_classed_address`]); the class map (class -> claimant module) is
//! the primary router for that space. the claimant is the verified MODULE
//! origin — a class is claimed by the module that serves it, so External and
//! System origins reject. first claim wins deterministically; a re-claim by
//! the owner is an idempotent no-op. there is deliberately NO unclaim op:
//! dropping a claim would dangle every `<class>:` route already minted, so
//! claims are permanent.
//!
//! ## State model
//!
//! pure logic over a host-injected [`sdk::MerkleStore`]: the HOST constructs
//! the concrete store (qmdb today — `statesync::qmdb::QmdbStore`) and hands
//! it to [`CapabilityRegistry::new`], so this crate never names a storage
//! crate. one logical record per announced node (`node\0{key}`, borsh) and
//! per claimed class (`class\0{name}`), plus the two rosters the scan reads
//! walk — the sorted node list (`nodes`, bounded by [`MAX_ANNOUNCED_NODES`])
//! and the sorted class list (`classes`, bounded by [`MAX_CLASSES`]). the
//! provider scans (`Providers` / `CapableProviders` / `All`) are
//! DISPATCH-CONSUMED (saga's assignment filters on them at execute), so they
//! stay canonical behind the capped roster; `Node` / `Resources` /
//! `ResolveClass` are point reads.
//!
//! writes are staged during a block and flushed to the store in one batch at
//! `commit_block`; the module root IS the store's merkle root. sync belongs
//! to the store, not this module: a joiner rebuilds the concrete store from
//! a peer (`QmdbStore::sync_from`) and wraps a fresh registry around it.
//!
//! oversized values never reach the store (the poison-value lesson): a node
//! entry is bounded by construction ([`MAX_CAPABILITIES`] tags of
//! `MAX_TAG_LEN` + [`MAX_RESOURCE_DIMS`] dimensions — `validate_tags` /
//! `validate_resources` gate every announce), a class record by
//! `MAX_CLASS_LEN`, and both rosters are byte-gated on top of their count
//! caps.

// the wire surface: this module's shared types, flattened at the crate root.
