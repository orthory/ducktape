//! acl is the on-chain SUBMIT-POLICY table: which [`Standing`] a target
//! module requires of an EXTERNAL submitter, resolved by the kernel host at
//! dispatch. the table is empty at genesis — a missing entry (after the `"*"`
//! fallback) is OPEN, so a fresh network admits any validly signed frame to
//! any module and the table exists only to TIGHTEN. mutation rides
//! governance's proposal ceremony as an [`AclMsg::SetPolicy`] follow-up;
//! reads go via [`AclQuery`] -> [`AclReply`].
