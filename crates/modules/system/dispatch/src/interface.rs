//! the dispatch module's public wire surface — types only.
//!
//! dispatch is the network's QUEUE plane: two committed FIFO queues the host
//! drains between blocks, and the recipe registry that feeds one of them.
//!
//! * the CALL QUEUE — calls a module queues on behalf of a program account it
//!   executes ([`DispatchMsg::Call`]). the host reads the committed head batch
//!   ([`DispatchQuery::PendingCalls`]), runs each call at its target as a
//!   `Program(account)`-origin unit under exactly the [`PendingCall::cause`]
//!   reported, and finalizes it back here ([`DispatchMsg::CompleteCall`]),
//!   which moves the call's outcome into the mailbox.
//! * the MAILBOX — items addressed to receiver modules: a saga result reaching
//!   the module that dispatched the work, or a call's completion reaching the
//!   module that queued it. the host reads the committed head batch
//!   (`Module::pending_items`), delivers each item in its own unit, and
//!   acknowledges it back here (`Module::acknowledge`). every mailbox payload
//!   is one [`Delivery`] envelope.
//!
//! a [`Recipe`] is a registered what-to-run manifest (required capability,
//! routing mode, output contract), and a [`DispatchMsg::Dispatch`] runs one
//! under it, carrying the entire prompt/input as opaque payload data. HOW an
//! executor runs is a host-side capability spec; WHAT ran, on whose behalf,
//! and what came back is consensus state here. no prompt text, no executor
//! name, and no domain vocabulary (chat, tasks, …) exists in this surface —
//! the module is deliberately 100% self-contained.
//!
//! ## the never-pop-stack rule
//!
//! a dispatch result is never returned into the requester's call path, and a
//! call's completion is never returned into the call's own unit. the outcome
//! lands as an ordered op (the saga callback, the host's `CompleteCall`), this
//! module records it and appends a mailbox item, and the block commits. only
//! the host's between-block pump, reading the COMMITTED mailbox, delivers the
//! item — in its own isolated unit, at least one block after the outcome
//! committed. a receiver that rejects a delivery is acknowledged
//! `Failed { reason }`: nothing of its unit commits, the item is retired with
//! that outcome on its receipt, and the queue keeps moving.
