//! the dispatch module — the network's queue plane.
//!
//! two committed FIFO queues, both drained by the host between blocks:
//!
//! * the CALL QUEUE. a module executing a program account queues a call on
//!   its behalf ([`DispatchMsg::Call`]); the host reads the committed head
//!   batch ([`DispatchQuery::PendingCalls`]), runs each call at its target as a
//!   `Program(account)`-origin unit, and finalizes it back here in order
//!   ([`DispatchMsg::CompleteCall`]), which moves the outcome into the mailbox.
//! * the MAILBOX. items addressed to receiver modules — a dispatch's judged
//!   saga result, a call's completion. the host reads the committed head batch
//!   (`Module::pending_items`), delivers each item in its own unit, and
//!   acknowledges it back here in order (`Module::acknowledge`).
//!
//! a [`Recipe`] is a consensus-registered what-to-run manifest: required
//! capability, routing mode, output contract. a module runs one with
//! [`DispatchMsg::Dispatch`], carrying the ENTIRE input as opaque payload
//! data. this module stages a saga trigger for the work (rendezvous over the
//! capability's providers, or statically pinned to one node), validates the
//! agreed result against the recipe's [`OutputContract`], and queues a
//! [`ResultEvent`] for the dispatching module in the mailbox.
//!
//! ## qmdb-backed
//!
//! the plane is pure logic over a host-injected [`sdk::MerkleStore`] with the
//! shared [`StagedStore`] overlay in front of it. every recipe, dispatch, call
//! and mailbox entry is its OWN store key (see `records`), so an op touches
//! only the keys it names, `root()` is the store's cached merkle root, and
//! state-sync rides the store's resolver lane rather than a byte snapshot
//! whose preimage was re-serialized on every single `root()` call.
//!
//! ## the never-pop-stack rule (delivery)
//!
//! an outcome is NEVER handed to its receiver inside the block that agreed on
//! it. the saga callback or the host's `CompleteCall` lands here, the outcome
//! is recorded and a mailbox item appended, and the block commits. the host's
//! between-block pump reads the COMMITTED mailbox head (`pending_items`, at
//! most [`MAX_DELIVERIES_PER_BLOCK`] items, FIFO), delivers each item to its
//! receiver in an isolated unit, and acknowledges it (`acknowledge`), which
//! retires the item; the receiver consumes the outcome in its own failure
//! domain. a receiver that rejects a delivery is acknowledged
//! `Failed { reason }`: nothing of its unit commits, the item is retired with
//! that outcome on its receipt (queryable as `DispatchStatus::Delivered` /
//! `CallStatus::Delivered`), and the queue keeps moving — a rejecting receiver
//! never stalls the plane.
//!
//! ## numbering
//!
//! every queue number (a call's `enqueued`, a mailbox `item`) is monotonic and
//! never reused: the cursors persist forever, a drained queue keeps
//! `head == next`. the host finalizes and acknowledges BY NUMBER and recovery
//! replays those ops, so a reused number would let a stale finalization or
//! acknowledgment retire a new entry. a below-head number is therefore always
//! an idempotent replay: `CompleteCall` re-checks the outcome digest and
//! `acknowledge` is a no-op.
//!
//! ## every record is written in full at admission
//!
//! the ops that retire an entry — `CompleteCall`, `acknowledge` — are the
//! host's, fixed, and run for every entry the plane admitted; they must never
//! fail on a record's size. so admission is where size is decided: a `Call` is
//! refused unless its record encodes under the store cap WITH a maximal
//! outcome in place, and a delivery's receipt is always strictly smaller than
//! the record that passed the cap.
//!
//! ## retention
//!
//! the RECORD is permanent, the OUTCOME is not. a dispatch record is the
//! network's turn-claim key — `runs` asks "does this dispatch id exist?" to
//! refuse a second run for a `run_id` it already ran, long after its own
//! pending entry is gone — and a call record is its id's permanent claim, so
//! neither is ever evicted. what is unbounded is the outcome: up to
//! [`MAX_RESULT_BYTES`] per dispatch, up to `sdk::MAX_OUTPUT_BYTES` per call.
//! acknowledgment therefore hands the bytes to the receiver and DROPS this
//! module's copy, leaving a receipt that keeps only what a reader can still
//! ask for: how the delivery ended, and for a call the outcome's summary
//! ([`CallOutcomeSummary`]: the output as a digest, the rest verbatim). state
//! then grows with the number of entries, not with the size of their
//! outcomes — and because each entry is its own record, that permanent count
//! costs nothing per op.
//!
//! ## self-containment
//!
//! this module imports no app module and no app interface. its collaborators
//! are saga (async work lifecycle), identity (the program-account control
//! record a call is admitted against) and the capability registry
//! (indirectly, via saga assignment). the receiver of a delivery is always
//! the module that dispatched or queued — `Dispatch` and `Call` are
//! module-origin-only — so outcomes route by construction, never by
//! configuration.

// the wire surface: this module's shared types, flattened at the crate root.
