//! the run workspace as a block device.
//!
//! Firecracker's device model is deliberately minimal — virtio-block, -net,
//! -vsock, -balloon, -rng and a serial console, nothing else. There is no
//! virtio-fs, so the workspace is handed over as a per-run ext4 image: built
//! from the workdir before boot, mounted by the guest init, and read back after
//! the guest reports its exit code.
//!
//! Both directions are ROOTLESS and mount-free. `mke2fs -d` populates an image
//! from a directory without ever mounting it, and `debugfs -R rdump` walks one
//! back out. That matters: a loop mount would need root, and a node that needs
//! root to move a workspace is a node that runs as root.
//!
//! The round trip is CPU-bound, not I/O-bound — measured at 186 MB/s and 8,860
//! files/s against an NVMe that sustains 2.9 GB/s, with `mke2fs` at 99% of one
//! core. Do not reach for faster storage to speed this up; the spec's *Build
//! caches* section records the measurement and the conclusion drawn from it.
