//! hiding host paths from the run.
//!
//! A run's argv and env are written on the host and carry host paths — the
//! operator's home directory, the node's data directory, the real workspace
//! location. Handing those to the guest leaks the operator's identity and
//! layout even though the guest cannot reach any of it.
//!
//! Under the microVM backend the guest layout is FIXED rather than planned:
//! there are no bind mounts to arrange, only block devices that always land at
//! the same mountpoints. So this module is a substring rewrite over a handful
//! of known pairs, not a mount planner.
