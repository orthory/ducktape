//! driving one microVM per run: the VMM's boot configuration.
//!
//! The schema is Firecracker's `--config-file` JSON, ON PURPOSE for both
//! flavors: the macOS shim (`bin/duck-vz-shim`) was written to consume this
//! exact schema, so there is one config builder, one set of drive-order
//! invariants and one test suite instead of a per-VMM pair drifting apart. The
//! only per-flavor knobs are the kernel command line ([`boot_args`]) and the
//! vsock `listen_ports` extension the shim needs (Firecracker forwards ANY
//! guest-dialled port to `<uds>_<port>`; Virtualization.framework wants each
//! listening port declared, and Firecracker's parser rejects unknown fields,
//! so the extension is emitted only for vz).
//!
//! Firecracker takes its whole configuration as a JSON file and boots straight
//! from it (`--config-file --no-api`), so this module does NOT speak the VMM's
//! HTTP API. That is a deliberate simplification over the obvious design and it
//! removes three failure modes: the wait for the API socket to appear (which
//! has no event seam and degrades into a spin), the `SUN_LEN` 108-byte cap that
//! bites any socket under a long workspace path, and a second HTTP client.
//!
//! What the API would buy is runtime control — pause, balloon, snapshot. The
//! spec puts snapshot restore in follow-on work, so none of it is needed yet.
//! Reach for `--api-sock` when a runtime command actually has a caller.
//!
//! [`boot_config`] is pure: the entire VM configuration is unit-testable
//! without a VMM, and the tests below are the guard on the parts that are
//! silently wrong rather than loudly wrong.
