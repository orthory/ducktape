//! the vsock wire between the host and one run's guest init.
//!
//! Deliberately tiny: a 1-byte tag, a 4-byte little-endian length, then the
//! payload. There is no handshake and no version byte — there are no live
//! networks and the guest image ships with the host that boots it, so the two
//! ends are always the same build.
//!
//! Every field here is written by an UNTRUSTED guest, so decoding refuses
//! rather than trusts: an unknown tag is an error, and a length header over
//! [`MAX_FRAME_BYTES`] is refused BEFORE anything is allocated.
//!
//! This module has no dependencies and does no I/O on purpose. The guest init
//! includes this same source file directly (`#[path = ...] mod guest_proto;`)
//! rather than depending on this crate, so PID 1 inside the VM does not carry
//! tokio, serde and tracing — while both ends still share one copy of the
//! codec. Keep it dependency-free or that arrangement breaks.
