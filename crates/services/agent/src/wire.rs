//! the node ↔ agent-daemon protocol: four commands down, four events up.
//!
//! Both directions ride the ONE ws connection the daemon dials at
//! `/v1/ws` — the same localhost surface the CLI uses. The daemon always
//! dials; the node never dials the daemon. That is what keeps a service plug
//! unprivileged: it needs no listening port, no address in the node's config,
//! and a node that has never heard from it simply has no interactive plane.
//!
//! ## why the session id is minted by the NODE
//!
//! The node owns the id because the id is also the correlation token: it names
//! the ws topic (`term:<id>`) subscribers are already attached to, it keys the
//! node's per-session metadata, and it lets an output frame that races the
//! create reply still find its session. A daemon-minted id would need a second
//! correlation field and a window where output has nowhere to land.
//!
//! ## what does NOT cross this boundary
//!
//! No key material and no credential secret. [`Credential`] is the *resolved
//! record* — a name, a duckdns authority, the local browser-gateway `via`, a
//! PUBLIC seal key and the account pubkey the grant is checked against. The
//! secret itself never leaves the lender's airlock; the daemon reconstructs a
//! `provider_host::AirlockConfig` from these public facts and the broker dials
//! for a sealed session exactly as the in-node path did.
