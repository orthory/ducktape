//! the collaboration delivery plane: bindings, a durable outbox, and the
//! provider adapters behind them.
//!
//! ## what this owns, and what it refuses to own
//!
//! It owns exactly the local half of delivery: which local session a
//! participant's input goes to, whether the bytes reached a provider, and what
//! the provider said about it. Everything else belongs to the network —
//! admission, authority, ordering, retention — and arrives here already
//! decided. In particular this plane **claims no task and schedules nothing**:
//! a delivery carries a task REFERENCE, which becomes a line in a wrapper and
//! never a claim made on the sender's behalf.
//!
//! ## why it is not part of [`crate::Sessions`]
//!
//! A pty session cannot outlive the link that created it: the node forgets it
//! on disconnect, so a survivor would be an unreachable container. A BINDING is
//! the opposite. The provider session it names is not this daemon's process,
//! was not started by it, and does not die with it — and the whole point of the
//! reconnect case is that a message queued while the node was away is
//! delivered, in sequence, when it comes back. So bindings and the outbox
//! survive a dropped link by construction: they live here, and nothing on this
//! plane is torn down by [`crate::Sessions::close_all`].
//!
//! ## the ordering that makes a crash reportable
//!
//! For every delivery, in this order and no other:
//!
//! 1. [`outbox::Outbox::queued`] — durable, THEN the node is told `Queued`.
//!    Queue ownership is never acknowledged from memory.
//! 2. [`outbox::Outbox::attempting`] — durable, THEN the adapter is called.
//! 3. the adapter's answer — durable, then reported.
//!
//! A crash between 2 and 3 is indistinguishable from success, so it recovers as
//! `DeliveryUnknown` and is never replayed automatically. See [`outbox`].
