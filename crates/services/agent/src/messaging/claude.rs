//! the Claude Code adapter: one named local session's per-session inbox.
//!
//! ## the interface, as the installed build actually behaves
//!
//! An interactive session binds a unix socket and publishes a registry entry
//! naming it. Both are per-session and per-user:
//!
//! - `<sockets dir>/<pid>.sock`, mode 0600 in a 0700 directory, the sockets
//!   dir being `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/cc-socks` where a runtime dir is set and
//!   `<temp dir>/cc-socks` where not (`/tmp/cc-socks-<uid>` when a socket
//!   path there would not fit a socket address);
//! - `<claude home>/sessions/<pid>.json` — `{pid, sessionId, messagingSocketPath, …}`;
//! - `<claude home>/sessions/<pid>.<sha256(socket path)>.key`, mode 0600 —
//!   `{peerToken, …}`.
//!
//! The socket speaks newline-delimited JSON, client to server only. An auth
//! line first, then frames. **The server never writes on the connection.**
//!
//! ## why this registers ONE session instead of scanning
//!
//! A binding names an immutable `sessionId`. [`resolve`] reads the registry and
//! takes the single entry carrying it — and refuses if two do. It never
//! enumerates the sockets in the directory and attaches to what it finds:
//! every session in there belongs to the same operating-system user, and
//! "everything this user is running" is not a thing anyone consented to
//! receive messages on. The `session_id` also goes out ON the frame, where the
//! RECIPIENT re-checks it and drops a mismatch, so a pid that has been reused
//! by a different session cannot be written into by accident.
//!
//! ## why a write is not an acceptance
//!
//! There is no acknowledgement of any kind on the socket. A message that
//! routes to the session's queue is silent, and so is one dropped for a
//! session-id mismatch or refused by the session's own inbound policy. Write
//! success therefore proves the SOCKET took the bytes and nothing about the
//! session.
//!
//! What does exist is a back-channel: a sender that supplies a `from` address
//! receives `{"type":"control","action":"peer_message_status",…}` frames for
//! `held | denied | expired | delivered | refused | dropped`. There is
//! deliberately no positive `accepted` status, so:
//!
//! - a status arrives → [`Outcome`] carries what it said;
//! - no status arrives → [`Outcome::Unknown`]. Never `Accepted`.
//!
//! [`Receipts`] is what makes the first case possible, and it is optional by
//! construction: if this daemon cannot bind its own address, every delivery
//! settles `DeliveryUnknown` instead. Degrading is correct here — the
//! alternative is inventing an acceptance nobody reported.
