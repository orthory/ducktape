//! the durable outbox: what this daemon took ownership of, and how far each
//! item got — written down BEFORE the thing it describes happens.
//!
//! ## the ordering, which is the whole point
//!
//! What matters is not the file format — an atomically rewritten state file
//! holding the same three-valued enum would do as well — but that one
//! particular write is DURABLE BEFORE an irreversible act, and that the check
//! and the claim are one critical section. An append-only journal is simply
//! the smallest thing that gives both.
//!
//! | last record for an item | what the provider may have seen | recovered as |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | [`Record::Queued`] | nothing — we had not offered it yet | `Queued`, safe to attempt |
//! | [`Record::Attempting`] | possibly the whole message | **`DeliveryUnknown`** |
//! | [`Record::Settled`] | whatever the state says | that state |
//!
//! A crash between `Attempting` and `Settled` is exactly the spec's "crashes
//! after provider input but before recording acceptance". The instruction may
//! already have been read and acted on, so this daemon MUST NOT replay it on
//! its own initiative: it keeps `DeliveryUnknown` and waits for someone with
//! authority to decide. An explicit retry reuses the same message id, so the
//! receiver can tell it may have seen it before.
//!
//! ## what is NOT in here
//!
//! No body is durable beyond the delivery attempt it belongs to, no provider
//! token, no socket path, no session id. A journal line names the message and
//! its state; recovering one is enough to REPORT, never enough to re-send.
//! (That is deliberate, and it is what makes automatic replay impossible by
//! construction rather than by discipline: after a restart this daemon no
//! longer holds the bytes it would have to replay.)
