//! `agent-service` — the execution half of the interactive terminal plane.
//!
//! This crate is what `ducktape service run agent` is made of. It owns the part
//! of a pty session that owns a PROCESS: resolving a provider tag, spawning the
//! sandboxed TUI, pumping its output, and tearing it down. It owns nothing
//! else — no scrollback ring, no ws topic, no mesh peer, no consensus query, no
//! admission decision. Those belong to the node, which drives this over
//! [`wire`].
//!
//! ## the boundary, and why it is here
//!
//! The pty plane splits at the pty, not at the session. Everything above the
//! pty is the node's by construction:
//!
//! - the scrollback and command rings are owned by the node's stream hub and
//!   read by its ws catch-up path;
//! - a pty client attaches to the NODE's `/v1/ws`, so `term:<id>` must be
//!   served there;
//! - cross-node sessions ride the mesh term plane, which authenticates peers by
//!   their mesh `PeerId` and answers admission from committed state on the
//!   node's actor lane — a daemon holds no keypair and no mesh identity.
//!
//! What is left below the pty is exactly this crate: a provider set, a bounded
//! map of live `InteractiveSession`s, one pump task each, and a wall-clock
//! reaper. That is also precisely the sandbox-touching part, which is the
//! point: after the carve the node process constructs no provider set and no
//! pty.
//!
//! ## the failure domain
//!
//! A session cannot outlive the connection that created it. When the link to
//! the node drops, [`Sessions::close_all`] ends every live session: the node
//! has already forgotten them (it cannot serve a topic it can no longer feed),
//! so a surviving pty would be an orphaned container nobody can reach or close.
