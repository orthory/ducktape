//! the off-loop execution pool: [`DispatchPool`] is the [`Worker`] real
//! hosts run.
//!
//! the worker step splits in two. the CHEAP half — decode routing and the
//! lease gate ([`crate::gate`]) — stays inline in `run()`, so the host's
//! event loop keeps its deterministic accept/skip verdicts. the EXPENSIVE
//! half — the provider CLI call, minutes-long under a 300s default timeout —
//! is handed to an injected spawner and `run()` returns "handled, result
//! later" immediately. the completed result re-enters through an injected
//! delivery lane as an ordinary submitted op, which is exactly what the
//! oracle-as-op contract expects: dispatch's never-pop-stack mailbox already
//! delivers results in a LATER block, so execution timing is invisible to
//! consensus.
//!
//! the pool is runtime-agnostic on purpose: it knows how to gate, dedup, and
//! cap — WHERE the future runs ([`SpawnFn`]) and WHERE the result goes
//! ([`DeliverFn`]) are the embedding host's business (bin/node's select-loop
//! mpsc lane, bin/noded's command channel).
