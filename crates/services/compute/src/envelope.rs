//! the run envelope — the structured payload the runs module composes and
//! this worker assembles into the final model input.
//!
//! consensus commits a JSON envelope (marker `ducktape_run`) carrying the
//! agent's curated SKILL PINS (name + duckfs prefix/snapshot + load mode), a
//! thread-continuity key, generic fallback instructions, the strict output
//! contract, and the rendered conversation. the host assembles
//! `<instructions>\n\n[<context>\n\n]<contract>\n\n<conversation>` (the
//! bracketed section rides only when the envelope carries it).
//!
//! An agent persona is represented as an always-loaded skill.
//! — the skills already ride the envelope as content-addressed duckfs pins, and
//! the provisioner assembles the `always` ones into the run's context document
//! (see [`crate::soul`]). that also kills the trap where a present `prompt_hash`
//! silently dropped `instructions`: the fallback is now reached by the ABSENCE
//! of always-skills, a state you can see.
//!
//! a payload that is not a run envelope — or one that cannot be honored
//! (wrong magic, malformed fields) — fails the run loudly: feeding a
//! half-understood payload is exactly the quiet corruption this format exists
//! to kill.
