//! the agent's SOUL: its curated skills, assembled into ONE markdown document
//! the executor's own CLI auto-loads.
//!
//! a soul is not a stored object — it is a BUILD PRODUCT. consensus commits
//! WHICH skills an agent carries (name + duckfs pin + load mode); the host
//! materializes them as ro mounts and assembles them here, in curation order:
//! every `always` skill inlined in full (this is where the retired
//! `prompt_hash` blob's text now lives), then an INDEX of the on-demand ones
//! (name, description, where to read the body), then the ambient tool-plane
//! instruction. one document, one delivery — capability-host decides the door
//! (the CLI's auto-load path, or the stdin prompt).
//!
//! PURE on purpose: no fs, no duckfs, no `SkillRef`. the provisioner (the only
//! layer allowed to touch the OS-side checkout engine) reads the materialized
//! `SKILL.md` files and calls [`assemble_context_doc`]; everything here is a
//! function of its argument, so the whole shape is unit-testable with no node.
//!
//! degrade rules, deliberately asymmetric: a skill with no/malformed
//! frontmatter still gets a name-only index entry (a cosmetic parse must never
//! fail a run), while a missing body for an `always` skill fails the run
//! loudly upstream — that one IS the persona, and running without it silently
//! produces a different agent.
//!
//! THREE TIERS of progressive disclosure, so run context never scales with the
//! size of the skill collection:
//! - tier 0, `always`: body inlined. costs O(persona).
//! - tier 1, curated `on_demand`: one index line + its mount path. costs
//!   O(curated count).
//! - tier 2, the GLOBAL LIBRARY under [`SKILL_LIBRARY_PREFIX`] in duckfs: NOT in
//!   context at all. the run is told, in one paragraph, that it exists and which
//!   MCP tools search and read it — but ONLY when the agent's caps actually let
//!   it read that prefix (`library_readable`). a document that tells an agent to
//!   open a door the tool plane will refuse is a document that lies; an agent
//!   without the grant simply never hears about the library. costs O(1) — a
//!   thousand library skills cost the same as none.
//!
//! the bounds below are what keep tiers 0 and 1 finite. they fail the run rather
//! than truncate it: a silently trimmed persona is a DIFFERENT AGENT with no
//! signal, which is strictly worse than a run that stops and says why.
