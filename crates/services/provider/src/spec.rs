//! the capability spec: a TOML file describing one executor capability.
//!
//! everything capability-host used to hardcode in Rust — which binary to
//! probe, the argv to invoke it, how to parse its output — is data in a spec
//! file. the built-in executors are embedded spec FILES (globbed by build.rs
//! — no Rust source names an executor) parsed by this exact module, so an
//! operator adding another executor writes a TOML file, not Rust:
//!
//! ```toml
//! spec = 1
//! [capability]
//! tag = "ollama"
//! description = "local ollama daemon via its cli"
//! [detect]
//! bin = "ollama"
//! [invoke]
//! args = ["run", "llama4"]
//! prompt = "stdin"
//! [output]
//! format = "text"
//! ```
//!
//! dispatch is by EXPLICIT capability tag — nothing is ever inferred from a
//! model name. a job names the tag it needs ("ollama"); the spec's argv says,
//! literally and completely, what running that tag means on this host (which
//! binary, which flags, which model — all operator policy). a finer-grained
//! need ("this executor, but with these exact flags") is a finer tag with its own
//! spec, not a routing rule — `[[variants]]` (see [`crate::variants`]) is
//! load-time sugar for writing a family of such finer tags in one file, each
//! still one tag with one fixed argv. no executor name appears anywhere in
//! this crate's code or tests — executors exist only as spec data.
//!
//! ## trust model — read this before adding spec sources
//!
//! a spec names an arbitrary local binary and the argv to run it with: loading
//! a spec is EXECUTING CODE by proxy. specs are operator-trusted configuration
//! — the same trust class as a shell profile or systemd unit. they load from
//! exactly two places, both local and operator-controlled: the specs embedded
//! in this crate at compile time, and `$DUCKTAPE_CAPABILITY_DIR` (default
//! `~/.ducktape/capabilities`). specs are NEVER fetched from the network, and
//! nothing consensus-side may ever read one (host-local files are
//! non-deterministic input; the consensus capability module sees only the
//! announced TAGS, never the specs behind them).
//!
//! ## how an executor authenticates — two paths, never both
//!
//! a provider child needs the operator's model credential, and there are
//! exactly two ways a spec can arrange that:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [isolation]                     # the STRONG path: the credential never
//! config_home_env = "CODEX_HOME"  # enters the child. the host reads it and
//! broker = "codex-responses"      # the child gets an opaque per-run bearer
//!                                 # aimed at a loopback endpoint. the fresh
//!                                 # config home is what FORCES that: without
//!                                 # it the CLI would just read ~/.codex.
//!
//! [sandbox]                       # the WEAK path: the CLI's own auth dir is
//! rw_dirs = ["~/.claude"]         # mounted into the sandbox, so the
//!                                 # credential DOES enter the child. for a BYO
//!                                 # CLI that only knows how to read dotfiles.
//! ```
//!
//! declaring BOTH is a HARD LOAD ERROR ([`parse_raw`]): an executor that HAS a
//! broker must never be able to silently regress to shipping its credential
//! dir into the child. the day an executor gains a broker, its `rw_dirs` go.
//!
//! ## override precedence
//!
//! embedded specs load first; operator specs load second and REPLACE an
//! embedded spec with the same tag wholesale (no field merging — a spec is
//! the unit of override). duplicate tags WITHIN the operator dir are a hard
//! error: two files claiming one tag is operator confusion, not a precedence
//! question.
