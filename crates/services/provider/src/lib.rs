//! host-side capability providers — the I/O half of the capability seam.
//!
//! the capability module (consensus) replicates *who provides what*; this
//! crate is the machine-local counterpart that actually provides it. a
//! [`Provider`] wraps one locally installed executor CLI, and [`discover`]
//! probes the host for the executors the operator brought — BYO by
//! construction: the operator logs their CLI in, the node just spawns it.
//!
//! ## where the credential goes
//!
//! BYO auth used to mean the node never touched a credential at all: the child
//! inherited the operator's environment and HOME, and the CLI found its own
//! dotfiles. that is still the floor, but a spec can now do better, and the two
//! options are mutually exclusive by construction (see [`spec`]):
//!
//!   * `[isolation]` — the only path. the HOST reads the credential and holds
//!     it in this process; a per-run loopback [`broker`] serves the model API
//!     and the child gets only an opaque bearer plus a FRESH, empty config home
//!     (so the CLI cannot fall back to reading the operator's real one). the
//!     credential never enters the child's process tree at all. codex and
//!     claude are both here. There is no second path: a run has no host
//!     filesystem to mount an auth dir from.
//!
//! orthogonally, [`SandboxBackend`] decides HOW the child is spawned (its own
//! microVM — never bare on the host).
//! the two compose: codex in a microVM gets the broker AND the jail.
//!
//! ## executors are data: the capability spec
//!
//! WHICH executors exist, how to detect them, the argv to run them, and how
//! to parse their output is all described by TOML capability specs (see
//! [`spec`] and `docs/records/specs/capability-spec.md`), not by Rust. the built-in
//! executor support ships as embedded spec files parsed by the same code
//! path as operator-provided specs under `$DUCKTAPE_CAPABILITY_DIR` (default
//! `<ducktape home>/capabilities`). adding an executor — or retuning a built-in's
//! flags, including which model it runs — is a config change on the
//! operator's machine, never a code change here. dispatch is by EXPLICIT
//! capability tag: [`ProviderSet::resolve`] takes the tag a job names,
//! nothing is inferred from model names.
//!
//! the CLIs are agentic, not plain inference endpoints, so a provider runs
//! them fenced: non-interactive mode, the sandbox flags encoded in the spec's
//! argv, and the workspace the provisioner materialized for this run as the
//! child's cwd (an empty scratch dir when the embedder provisioned none). the
//! child never sees the node's data directory itself. every run starts cold —
//! a run's whole continuity is its prompt envelope, which is what lets any
//! assignee execute it.

    ///   "trusted" is a guest this run booted and destroys.
    /// - That sandbox has a private netns and an egress allowlist (broker +
    ///   node RPC + public), so a project hook reaches nothing the run was not
    ///   already given.
    /// - `$HOME` is never mounted (D7): the config home the trust decision is
    ///   written into IS this run's, drawn per run and deleted with it.
    /// - Above all, the process being asked is an agent already executing
    ///   model-directed commands in that sandbox. A `.claude/settings.json`
    ///   inside the workdir cannot widen a boundary the agent is already
    ///   inside — it is strictly less than what the run can do by design.
    ///

    /// workdir is as trusted as the run itself*. It asserts nothing about the
    /// operator's machine, because the child cannot reach it.
    ///

/// * `/v1/submit/frame` — self-authenticating: the frame's own signature IS
///   its origin, so a guest with no key can put nothing through it;
/// * `/v1/services/hello`, volatile presence that ages out on its own TTL;
/// * `/v1/ws` — no credential of any kind, and it carries the `logs` topic, so
///   a guest can read this operator's log ring;
/// * EGRESS OFF THIS HOST — `/v1/gateway/proxy` dispatches a `GatewayJob::Http`
///   over the overlay to a publisher node, and its only gate,
///   `gateway_http::gateway_api_origin_allowed`, is a header check a native
///   caller passes by sending no headers. `/v1/gateway/browser` likewise.
///
/// Out of reach: every other port and every other address on this host (no
/// listener is bound for them, with or without a NIC); `/v1/admin/*`; and the
/// NODE-LEVEL mutations — `/v1/invite`, `/v1/log-filter`, `/v1/term/sessions`
/// and `DELETE /v1/fs/workspaces/{id}` — which take either this node's
/// operator credential (a 0600 file in a workspace the guest has no path to)
/// or a signature by the key the node knows as its operator's

/// `git-receive-pack` takes the same two proofs in git's own shapes — a
/// `git push --signed` certificate or that operator credential in a header —
/// and a guest can present neither.
///
