//! interactive, pty-backed CLI sessions — the same executor a headless run
//! spawns, but attached to a pseudo-terminal so a human can drive its native
//! TUI (codex, claude) keystroke-by-keystroke instead of feeding it one prompt
//! on stdin.
//!
//! This shares the headless path's whole isolation seam — the broker holds the
//! credential and the child gets only an opaque bearer + loopback base URL, the
//! fresh config home stops any dotfile fallback, and the microVM fences
//! everything else — and differs in exactly two places: the argv is the spec's
//! `[interactive]` TUI argv (not `[invoke]`'s headless one), and the child's
//! stdio is a pty, not pipes.
//!
//! **The pty is allocated where the child runs.** A pty master and its slave
//! are two ends of ONE kernel object, so a session inside a guest cannot be
//! given a terminal from here: `duck-guest-init` opens the pair, and the
//! operator's keystrokes reach it as ordinary stdin frames. That is the whole
//! of [`Transport`]'s two variants — the operator's own vendor login runs on
//! this host and gets a host pty; every lent session runs in a guest and gets a
//! guest one.
//!
//! **Sandboxed only.** A bare spawn would have no fresh HOME and no filesystem
//! fence, so an interactive session outside the sandbox would expose the
//! operator's whole home to whoever is typing — the exact thing the sandbox
//! exists to prevent, and exactly why [`crate::SandboxBackend`] cannot express
//! one; the host-pty primitive underneath
//! ([`InteractiveSession::spawn_on_pty`]) is reachable on its own only for that
//! vendor login.
//!
//! There is deliberately NO idle-timeout kill here (a terminal is idle by
//! nature): a session ends on explicit [`InteractiveSession::close`], on the
//! child exiting (the master read returns EIO → EOF), or when dropped. Spend is
//! bounded by the broker's own request/byte caps, not by output silence.
