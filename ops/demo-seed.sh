# Inits a solo (1-validator) workspace named "demo" under the ducktape home —
# the SAME directory listing the desktop app reads — builds its guest images,
# starts its node briefly, POSTs a batch of seed ops
# over the node's /v1/submit lane (each finalized into DURABLE qmdb state),
# then stops the node. Open the app and pick the "demo" network: the app
# respawns the node from the same durable dir, fully populated.
#
# Re-runnable: stops whatever still serves the "demo" workspace, wipes it and
# recreates it each time (ops/demo-clear.sh; other workspaces under the home
# are untouched). Ports are freshly allocated.
#
# It also publishes two gateway web-app routes (see ops/demo-gateway.mjs): a
# NETWORK-hosted static site served from DuckFS, and a USER-hosted route that
# proxies to a node-local server. The frameless /v1/submit lane stamps the
# node's own validator key as the op origin. Its account controls the model
# user; the separate demo wallet signs and owns the gateway routes.
#
# The model user (ChiefDuck) is the network's resident maintainer: a real
# agent on the `claude` capability, granted every action the platform knows,
# forge read and push on `ducktape` and on a seeded `playground` repo, every
# page, and the shared skill library — with its persona curated as an
# always-loaded skill (ops/chiefduck/SKILL.md). The two seeded @mentions (one
# in #general, one on a playground issue) run once `make dev` has installed
# the claude CLI into the workspace and the compute service announces it:
# a chat reply, and a pull request opened from a microVM.

rejection. This is a demo garnish only: chat, tasks, pages and your identity are

Gateway web apps published on this node (open in the app's browser):
  • site.$ID.duck — a bouncing-DVD web app, served static from DuckFS by
                    consensus. Works now — nothing else to run.
  • app.$ID.duck  — user-hosted web app. The route is published, but its upstream
                    is a plain process YOU host. It shows "Unavailable" in the
                    Gateway view until you serve it, and goes Unavailable again if
                    that process stops:

                        make demo-app        # keep this running (foreground)

                    Re-run it after every \`make demo-seed\` (a re-seed wipes the
                    workspace and re-mints the loopback binding).

Done with the demo? \`make demo-clear\` removes the workspace entirely.
