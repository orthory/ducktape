# make wasm-repro-check — prove a guest's bytes depend on nothing builder-local.
#
# guest-builder compiles a module out of the platform repository at a
# revision, never out of the checkout: the module, the SDK and every sibling
# it reads come from one git source, whose location is no part of a symbol
# hash, and every path that could reach the bytes as a panic location (the
# cargo home, the rustup home, the scratch shell, the unpacked revision) is
# remapped to a fixed token (`remap_flags` in bin/guest-builder/src/main.rs).
#
# It builds ONE module (the smallest — every module shares the same prefixes)
# twice, in two scratch directories, and asserts BOTH that the two artifacts
# are byte-identical and that neither carries a host path. Both assertions
# earn their keep: the two builds share $HOME and the same unpacked revision,
# so a dropped remap flag leaves them identical to each other and only the
# host-path scan catches it, while a scratch path leaking into the bytes is
# caught only by the comparison.
#
# Needs the wasm32-unknown-unknown target, wasm-tools and a pushed HEAD, so it
# is NOT part of `make test`; `make wasm-modules-check` carries the cheap
# host-path half.
