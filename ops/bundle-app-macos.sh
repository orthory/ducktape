# Native macOS bundle: stage both executables and the view files, then —
# on the local signing path — sign inside-out, image, optionally notarize.
#
# ONE signing path per environment, chosen by DUCKTAPE_SIGN_VIA:
#   unset    local: DUCKTAPE_CODESIGN_IDENTITY (ad-hoc by default) signs the
#            bundle and the DMG here; the three DUCKTAPE_NOTARY_* notarize.
#   airlock  the airlock gateway signs: the bundle is staged UNSIGNED — no
#            codesign, no DMG, no notarization here — for `ducktape release
#            sign-bundle` (make release-app) to send to the enclave. Any of
#            the local identity/notary variables set alongside is refused
#            (`sign_path_conflict`); there is no fallback from one to the other.
#
# Ducktape.app ships TWO executables in Contents/MacOS: `ducktape-launcher`
# is the CFBundleExecutable (what LaunchServices runs; it reads the update
# state and `exec`s the app) and `ducktape-app` beside it is the app itself.
# A helper executable in Contents/MacOS is nested code, so it is signed
# FIRST, then the bundle (which signs the main executable and seals the
# rest): `codesign --verify --deep --strict` — what `ducktape-launcher
# --qualify` runs on a staged release — passes on the bundle as built, with
# nothing added or re-sealed after the fact.
