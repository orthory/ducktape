# make dev — the desktop-app dev loop against a fresh "demo" localnet.
#
# Offers this host's setup as two prompts up front (which agent CLIs this node
# lends to runs, and on macOS the sandbox prerequisites), then founds the
# "demo" network anew (ops/demo-seed.sh: it stops and clears whatever a
# previous lap left, then seeds from the founding set THIS build staged),
# starts its node, starts the three local agent services, initializes its
# forge with ducktape's own repository (ops/dogfood-forge.sh), then runs the
# desktop app in the foreground.
#
# The demo network is disposable: every lap founds it from the modules, index
# guests and views the build just staged, so nothing from an earlier lap — a
# genesis without today's views, a service bound to a workspace that no longer
# exists — survives into the next. Ctrl-C quits the app and leaves the node
# and services up for app-only relaunches (`cargo run -p ducktape-app`); the
# next `make dev` replaces them. `make dev-clear` stops that background
# runtime without deleting state; `make demo-clear` removes the workspace
# entirely.
