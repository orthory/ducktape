//! Compare-on-write for the compiler-maintained state revision counters.
//!
//! Every app-state and component-state field carries a revision the generated
//! write helper bumps, and `lazy` keys its memo off those revisions instead of
//! cloning and hashing the values. An assignment that stores an equal value
//! should not tick the revision — but the generator cannot require
//! `PartialEq` of an extern Rust type the author declared. Autoref
//! specialization decides at the call site: [`state_changed!`] expands to
//! `(&Rev(&old)).ice_changed(&new)`, which method resolution binds to the
//! comparing [`RevChanged`] impl on `Rev<T>` when `T: PartialEq` and falls
//! through to the always-`true` [`RevFallback`] impl on `&Rev<T>` otherwise.
//! The fallback is the documented trade-off: a write through a type without
//! `PartialEq` always counts as a change.
//!
//! Revisions also identify the INSTANCE: the memo parking lot is per thread
//! and keyed by codegen site, reconciliation scope, and the hashed revision
//! tuple, so two app or component instances that share a site and scope —
//! one test driver after another on the same thread, a mounted component
//! leaving and coming back — must never hash alike. [`seed`] gives every
//! instance a starting revision no other instance in the process gets.
